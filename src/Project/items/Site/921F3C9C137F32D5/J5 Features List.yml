        <p>Our vessels can store up to 1,660 ft3 of bulk materials.<br />
        <br />
        The trailer is deployed empty to well locations. The trailer&rsquo;s hydraulic landing legs are contracted, and the four-tank trailer drops to the ground, where it is supported by a specially designed under-frame structure.<br />
        <br />
        Paint<br />
        The paint system is shot-blast with epoxy primer and acrylic urethane top coat with the customer&rsquo;s choice of color and other finish details. Optional organic zinc-rich primer is available for units operated in marine environments or other harsh operating areas.<br />
        <br />
        Warranty<br />
        Wilco WST-1600 bulk storage trailers are warrantied for 12 months from shipment date for repairs resulting from workmanship. Components for outside vendors including engines, compressors, axles, and suspension are covered by the original manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty.</p>

        <p>
        Four ASME-code pneumatic storage silos are mounted on an open-frame trailer that can store up to 1,660 ft<sup>3</sup> of bulk materials. The trailer is deployed empty to well locations and is easily setup onsite; the hydraulic landing legs are retracted, resting the trailer&rsquo;s under-frame on the ground and allowing the trailer to support the weight of the stored bulk cement. Bulk cement is conveniently and quickly unloaded using a trailer-mounted air compressor, powered by an on-board diesel engine.&nbsp;<br />

        When space utilization is a concern, we also offer the market&rsquo;s largest vertical storage solution with our 1,610-ft<sup>3</sup> vertical deployment system.</p>
