        <p>The Wilco&trade; WFM-100 frac fluid mixer trailer is designed for transporting 100 bbl of 8.6 lb/gal fluid and is equipped with an additive system that is used for circulation and high-rate discharge of fracturing fluids.</p>
        <p>Fill, circulate, and discharge your fluids with our versatile mixing-displacement manifold. This is designed to move fluid from anywhere to anywhere with one of the two Mission&trade; pumps on the trailer. You can move fluids to the mixer tank, blend and recirculate through two tanks, and then displace to the treating fluid blender. Our manifold system is set up to perform a variety of different styles of blending and is latched to the trailer frame sides.<br />
        <br />
        Fluid may be added to the mix tanks by either of two methods: pumping fluid from another vessel via a 3-in. fill line into the top of the mixing vessel or pumping using the on-board 3&times;2&times;13-in. centrifugal pumps&rsquo; fluid via the 3-in. suction manifold.<br />
        <br />
        The fluid mixture within the mix tank can then be recirculated. The recirculated fluid flows through the mixing-agitation apparatus in the mix vessel. It is then pumped out the bottom of the vessel with a 3&times;2&times;13-in. centrifugal pump and then circulated back up through the top of the mixing tank. The process is continuous, and the recirculating fluid can be mixed with more fluid or additives, which can be added into the vessel via the top fill line or manually through the manway.</p>
