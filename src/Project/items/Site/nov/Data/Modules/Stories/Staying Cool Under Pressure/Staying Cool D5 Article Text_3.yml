        <p>Air systems have limited value in regions with extreme climates. This is especially true in places like the Middle East where temperatures can climb above 120 degrees Fahrenheit/49 Celsius. Water-based cooling systems require a local water source &ndash; an uncertain commodity at some remote land drilling sites. </p>
        <p>In 2015, a detailed field study in the Eagle Ford shale tested how well TUNDRA MAX could reduce drilling fluid temperatures at a high flow rate with a small footprint. The study compared wells in South Texas equipped with advanced drilling automation tools, both with and without the mud chiller. The analysis included drilling speed, efficiency and downhole tool operational safety. </p>
        <p>The well not using the mud chiller logged two temperature-related downhole tool failures, causing significant downtime. When TUNDRA MAX was activated on the second well, the operator reported zero temperature-related failures. A reduction in downhole tool trips alone allowed the well to be drilled two days faster than the previous well. </p>
