        <p>Imagine the Seabox SWIT technology as a structure that sits on the seabed and uses an injection pump to draw seawater through it. Disinfection chemicals such as chlorine and hydroxyl radicals are generated via electrolysis on their way through specially designed cells, removing the need for liquid chemicals or moving parts. The convoluted path and long residence time inside the box remove solids via sedimentation and provide a chlorine soak that thoroughly kills bacteria. The system can be scaled to any volume requirement, producing injection water with quality far superior to that of topside systems.</p>
        <p>Subsea water treatment allows reservoir engineers to inject as much water as they need &ndash; when and where they need it &ndash; without relying on topside infrastructures. The system increases flexibility by relocating treatment units on the seabed, allowing injection to continue independently of platform production shutdowns.</p>
        <p>The lack of moving or rotating parts supports a proven record of 99.8 percent reliability, compared with 85 percent for most surface-based seawater injection systems.</p>
