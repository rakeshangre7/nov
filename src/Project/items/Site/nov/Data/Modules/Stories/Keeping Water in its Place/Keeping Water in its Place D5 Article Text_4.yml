        <p>The large-volume still room weighs 47 tons/43 tonnes and contains a removable &ldquo;treatment unit&rdquo; with a maintenance window of up to four years. The system only requires electrical power for the electrolysis and control systems, with a design life of more than 20 years. The lack of moving or rotating parts supports a proven record of 99.8 percent reliability, compared with 85 percent for most surface-based seawater injection systems.</p>
        <p>Major multi-national oil companies have acknowledged the Seabox SWIT technology as fundamental to adding incremental water injection with minimal facility pre-investment, allowing flexible adjustments to reservoir drainage strategies for the lifetime of a field. The technology offers significant environmental and safety benefits that include lower power requirements, no liquid-dosed chemicals, zero chemical handling and reduced offshore manning requirements.</p>
        <p>Far below the surface of the ocean, Seabox will quietly transform top-heavy water treatment into a lean, green, maintenance-free machine.</p>
