        <p>Up to 50 percent more oil can be tapped by increasing reservoir pressure via water injection and other methods. Global water injection requirements are projected to double or triple within 10 years, with offshore drilling creating much of this demand.</p>
        <p>Removing sediment and bacteria from injection water is never cheap, and moving the process offshore only increases complexity. Oil and gas companies rely on preliminary well test information to estimate oil reserves and production rates before investing in costly topside water treatment systems. Even tiny miscalculations can lose millions of dollars. &ldquo;Life-of-field&rdquo; water injection requirements rarely match initial expectations, particularly if satellite fields are discovered and processed via the same offshore infrastructure.</p>
