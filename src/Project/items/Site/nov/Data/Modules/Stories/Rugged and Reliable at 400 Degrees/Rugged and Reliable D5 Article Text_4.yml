        <p>Drill string fatigue failure is the most common and costly type of drilling failure, with an estimated $100,000 per failure. Monitoring the complete history of assets can detect repetitive issues - such as thread galling, pitted seals or disproportionate connection repairs - and take worn elements out of service before they fail.</p>
        <p>A well-documented, current asset inventory can intercept drill pipe that should be repaired or retired. Without this information, fatigued assets can mistakenly become part of a drill string and later fail during drilling. Reliable inventory and quality control can reduce handling costs by up to 90 percent and lower thread repair costs by 44 percent.</p>
