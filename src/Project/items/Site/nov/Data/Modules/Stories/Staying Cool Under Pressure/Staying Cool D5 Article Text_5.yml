        <p>Well operators in southern Louisiana have also confirmed the high performance of TUNDRA MAX. The mud chiller was enabled on a well at 16,900 feet/5,150 meters, reducing the temperature gradient by 15 percent and saving 28 hours of temperature-related downtime.</p>
        <p>TUNDRA MAX mud chillers eliminate dependence on local air and water conditions while extending equipment life and increasing drilling performance. These tough, efficient units are giving well operators a faster, more reliable way to beat the heat.</p>

        <p>In this same study, the battery on the high-speed downhole dynamics measurement tool achieved 240 of 250 hours of maximum battery life. This unprecedented 44% increase&mdash;up from 167 typical hours&mdash;was credited to TUNDRA MAX reducing bottomhole temperature by 22 &deg;F (12 &deg;C).</p>
        <p>Superior cooling reduced the amount of circulation required to lower the temperature of the well. The cooler environment gained an additional 1,000 ft (305 m) before equipment-damaging temperatures were encountered. Drilling restarted sooner and saved 51 hours of nonproductive time.</p>
        <p>Well operators in southern Louisiana have also confirmed the high performance of TUNDRA MAX. The mud chiller was enabled on a well at 16,900 ft (5150 m), reducing the temperature gradient by 15% and saving 28 hours of temperature-related downtime.</p>
