        <p>Within normal temperature ranges, drilling fluid protects downhole equipment and maintains optimal performance. Extreme temperatures degrade mud properties, creating issues such as increased mud loss, thermal instability, and inconsistent rheology measurements. Mud performs best at lower temperatures, saving the cost of additives or replacement.</p>
        <p>Cooler drilling fluid prevents heat-related equipment failures and recoups time throughout the drilling process. Stable downhole temperatures reduce the time needed to recondition mud returned from the wellbore. This speeds up the process to reoptimize mud formulas for downhole temperature fluctuations, all while providing better wellbore stability.</p>
        <p>TUNDRA MAX performs when conventional cooling methods fail. Air cooling is slow, inefficient, and highly dependent on ambient temperatures. The dual-stage cooling system can actually reduce the temperature of processed drilling fluid to below the ambient air temperature.</p>

        <p>Air systems have limited value in regions with extreme climates. This is especially true in places like the Middle East, where temperatures can climb above 120 &deg;F (49 &deg;C). Water-based cooling systems require a local water source&mdash;an uncertain commodity at some remote land drilling sites.</p>
