      Value: "<p>Dreco was first started in 1972 as Pyramid Steel before changing its name to Derrick and Rig Equipment Co. in 1976. Its founding in the Rocky Mountains of Edmonton, Canada, proved to be the perfect environment for designing and constructing some of the most rugged and reliable drilling rigs built for Arctic weather. As one of the fastest-growing rig builders in oilfield history at the time, Dreco steely navigated through the oilfield downturn of the early 1980s, later re-emerging as an industry-leading supplier of drilling rig structures and machinery. Today, Dreco continues to lead the competition in the design and construction of rig equipment, including derricks, masts, slingshots, substructures, skidding systems, and more.</p>"
