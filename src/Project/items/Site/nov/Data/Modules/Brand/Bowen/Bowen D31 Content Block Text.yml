      Value: "<p>After his father S.R. Bowen founded the first Bowen-named company in the early 1910s, Walter Bowen and a friend moved to Houston and formed Bowen Company of Texas in 1934&mdash;a time when oil exploration and drilling were accelerating within the era of the Great Depression. One year later, Bowen became a leader in innovation with the creation of the first overshot, the Series 150. This tool set the standard for fishing equipment, and its quick acceptance assured company partners that their business would be successful. Bowen&rsquo;s reputation for well tool design and construction continues today with our Wide Catch overshot, which offers up to four times extended catch range versus any other overshot on the market.</p>"

        <h2>More than a name. Our legacy.</h2>
        <p>Bowen dates back more than 105 years, when S.R. Bowen founded his first company in Coalinga, California. Shortly after the United States entered World War I, S.R. sold the Coalinga shop. He formed a second company, the S.R. Bowen Company, in 1920 in Huntington Beach.</p>
        <p>In the early 1930s, the consequences of the stock market crash prompted S.R. Bowen to consider starting a company in Houston, where oil exploration and drilling was accelerating. In the early spring of 1934, his son Walter and a friend formed Bowen Company of Texas.</p>
        <p>Bowen&trade; became a leader in innovation with the creation of the first overshot, the Series 150, in 1935. This tool set the standard for fishing equipment, and the quick acceptance of the tool assured the company partners that their business would be successful. The company continued to create new products, building a reputation for their well tool design and construction.</p>
        <p>NOV acquired Bowen in 2000, and we continue to design and provide the world's most advanced fishing tool technology.</p>
