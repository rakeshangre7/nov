        <p>Derricks and Diamonds began as a grass roots initiative for the first and second classes of the NOV Next Generation Program in 2005. The &ldquo;Next Gen&rdquo; Program recruited, trained, placed, and retained high potential college graduates from various global universities at NOV. Many Next Gen alumni work at NOV today. They are united through their shared experiences, and for early Next Gen participants, their involvement in Derricks and Diamonds.</p>
        <p>Challenged by management to identify a community investment opportunity, approximately 30 Next Gen members connected and started envisioning possibilities. Since they were all new to the energy industry, the members reached out to friends and family members to explore ideas on how they could make a meaningful, positive impact in the community. Common themes the Next Gen group encountered while brainstorming included a manageable, team-oriented endeavor that families could enjoy together.</p>
        <p>Softball made sense.</p>
        <p>It was a weekend event and a decidedly inclusive sport. The Derricks and Diamonds name was born soon thereafter as a nod to the industry partnerships (Derricks) and sport tournament of choice (Diamonds).&nbsp; The Next Gen class members reached out to customers and vendors in the industry to onboard teams, and the platform for fundraising in support of a significant cause gained momentum.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the group worked on deciding the charitable beneficiaries for Derricks and Diamonds. A Next Gen class member whose brother had survived pediatric cancer suggested Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital (TCH) because of the support they had provided his brother and their family. After a few discussions, the first beneficiary was selected and Derricks and Diamonds was officially launched, initially as a softball tournament fundraiser.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite industry downturns, management changes, and company mergers, Derricks and Diamonds has withstood the test of time. The organization is supported by a caring group comprised of the NOV global family that continue to help children living with cancer year after year. Over time, Derricks and Diamonds has matured and evolved into an advocacy group. Its members work all year-long to produce philanthropic events which unite the oil and gas industry in support of TCH and Snowdrop Foundation.</p>
