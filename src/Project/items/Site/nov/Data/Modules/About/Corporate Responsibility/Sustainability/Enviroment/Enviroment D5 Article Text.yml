        <p>
        &nbsp;<br />
        Within the past few years , we developed systems to track and reduce our energy use. The NOV Energy Use Survey was created specifically to record monthly electricity, natural gas, and fuel usage at every facility and provide an accurate picture of NOV’s overall energy consumption and meet global greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements. We will continue to monitor legislation and report as necessary.</p>
        <p>
        <br />
        The largest obligation is in the United Kingdom, where energy laws were put into effect under the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC). After much debate, the Environmental Agency, through the CRC, has essentially implemented a tariff on carbon emissions. NOV successfully reported in July 2012 and July 2013 to the UK Environmental Agency and has met all its obligations to the CRC to date.&nbsp; We are continuing to monitor our energy use and implementing reduction measures. In the United States, NOV successfully reported to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Reporting Rule for the facilities that have mandatory obligations by the April 2012 deadline . All facilities in the United States have been evaluated for applicability to regulatory obligations and reported on as necessary. The Australia legislature recently passed the Clean Energy Legislation to track and price greenhouse gas emissions beginning July 1, 2012.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        <br />
        Improving energy efficiency</p>
        <p>
        In addition to meeting all our greenhouse gas and energy use reporting requirements, we are committed to improving the energy efficiency of our operations. Energy efficiency and green technologies are part of the considerations taken when building new facilities and remodeling older ones. Energy efficiency building requirements and regulations are being met for our new facilities in England and Scotland; these requirements are also being used as recommendations and considerations for new facilities and developments in Brazil, the United States, and other locations in which we operate.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        NOV has also formed a global energy team to perform energy audits on the individual facilities. These energy audits have revealed multiple measures that can be taken across the global enterprise to increase energy efficiency and reduce NOV’s overall energy consumption and spending as well as facility-specific reduction opportunities. To perform these energy audits, the corporate energy team works in conjunction with a target facility and analyzes equipment, lighting, HVAC units, and energy consumers to develop a report outlining the facility’s largest energy consumers and recommendations for reduction and efficiency improvements. Recommendations range cleaning skylights to allow for brighter facilities and the possibility to eliminate some artificial light use to the purchase of efficient HVAC units or even improved process designs.</p>
        <p>
        LED lighting uses a fraction of the power that traditional light fixtures use, and improvement in LED technology has enabled NOV to use LED lighting in our manufacturing facilities. Since 2010, NOV has retrofitted numerous facilities in the United States, Canada, and China with LED lighting. Additional, many newly constructed facilities use LED lighting.</p>
        <p>
        At one of NOV’s facilities in Stonehouse, England, engineers and the HSE group teamed up to design a system that would capture waste heat generated by their energy-efficient HVAC units and recycle it back into the building. The system is set to a thermostat, so it only recycles the heat at appropriate times, alleviating the amount of energy needed to heat the building during cold months while eliminating wasted heat generated.</p>
        <p><strong>Freshwater Management</strong></p>
        <p>Wastewater treatment and recycle systems installed across the US and Canada allow NOV to conserve water.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        Manufacturing and production activities typically require large quantities of water. Because water is a natural resource, protecting and preserving freshwater supplies involves understanding supply and demand trends at the local level, assessing potential effects on quality and quantity, and implementing steps to appropriately address the challenges. Environmental site assessments are regularly conducted to identify potential risks and create actionable items to improve environmental stewardship. We recognize the need to conserve water resources, and we have developed and implemented a number of technologies to clean industrial water for reuse. Through process improvements and water management awareness, our use of fresh water is lessened, and the volume of generated waste water is reduced. NOV uses wastewater treatment and recycle systems across the US and Canada to conserve water and reduce costs of monitoring and disposal. Implementing automated, self-contained water recycling systems increases efficiency and operations by using automatic controls to adjust pH and oxidizer levels, automatically monitor and backwash filters, and dispense of sludge. These systems produce cleaner water while reducing odor, maintenance costs, and cost of fresh water.</p>
        <p>
        To maintain compliance with regional and local water specifications and regulations, NOV communicates and cooperates with local officials and agencies regarding storm-water and wastewater generation. At many locations, NOV has installed oil/water separators to capture and treat water used in cleaning and manufacturing operations. These systems are specifically designed to treat waste water to meet or exceed regulatory specifications for release to city or regional water systems. NOV also works closely with wastewater treatment plants by designing specialized pumps to increase plant efficiency as well as pumps for the desalination market.</p>
        <p><strong>Risk Management</strong></p>
        <p>Environmental audits are regularly performed on existing facilities to meet regulatory obligations and to meet or exceed industry standards. Due-diligence consists of evaluating locations and sites to analyze their purchase or lease potential.</p>
        <p>
        Findings from these audits manifest themselves in corrective actions that are intended to reduce potential negative environmental effects and to meet regulatory obligations. For example, NOV is currently working to meet obligations in Alberta, Canada, by installing new fuel tanks with containments as directed by the Petroleum Tank Management Association of Alberta . Also, NOV constantly works to identify and address areas that need containments to proactively manage operational materials. To further protect water discharge areas, NOV has installed several oil/water separators and water treatment systems to reduce the amount of water used annually at our facilities as well as to meet regulatory specifications. Active efforts to contain, minimize, and eliminate sources for spills and contamination have proven to be an essential part of operating efficiently, effectively, and ethically.</p>
        <p><strong>Waste Management</strong></p>
        <p>NOV is in the process of transitioning&nbsp; to a proactive model of minimizing waste throughout all facilities. Over the last few years, many NOV facilities have implemented programs to reduce the amount of regulated waste generated by identifying areas for process optimizations and changing materials used in operations. These waste management programs are guided by NOV’s efforts for sustainable practices and are also in compliance with regulatory requirements and the cost of disposal that NOV has previously incurred. Regulations and laws governing waste management, disposal, and volumes are identified in the regions in which we operate, and NOV maintains compliance with these obligations. Specific governing agencies and regulations include Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title II annual waste reporting, National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemical Substances (REACH), which all necessitate monitoring and documentation of proper storage and disposal of chemicals and wastes at our facilities. Some of the regulations are state-, city-, or region-specific. For example, if a facility is categorized by the EPA as a “Large Quantity Generator” or reports a “Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Form R” chemical in the state of Texas, the facility must produce a Source Reduction/Waste Minimization Plan. These plans outline a 10% reduction within a 5-year period, and NOV continues to meet these requirements.</p>
        <p>
        To reduce the amount of regulated waste generated, NOV has actively researched and implemented materials that are less hazardous to employees and the environment. In doing so, many facilities have changed from oil-based to water-based solvents.</p>
        <p>
        Many technologies have also been implemented to reduce waste and emissions. At several facilities, NOV has installed regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTOs), which are used as volatile organic compound (VOC) emission control systems. The RTOs are essential to reducing volatile organic constituents and reducing NOV’s overall waste.</p>
        <p>
        To manage trash, NOV has encouraged and implemented good housekeeping practices, proper storage and containment designs, and recycling streams for solvents, scraps, and paper throughout our facilities. Several NOV facilities have implemented recycling programs that also collect plastics, aluminum cans, cardboards, and other recyclables.</p>
        <p>
        To protect employees, meet legal obligations, and encourage sustainable practices, training and support are provided on a regular basis by Corporate HSE, the Environmental Risk group, and the individual business unit HSE groups to the operations that fall under waste reporting regulations. As a global company, NOV is continuing to expand the recycling and minimization efforts among our facilities and will be developing and refining the tracking methodology for minimization of several types of waste. NOV’s HSE Management System is moving to support waste minimization efforts through electronic benchmarking, measuring, tracking progress, and reporting. Ultimately, NOV will manage all waste information and chemical inventories through our Environmental Management System (EMS) to support our global reporting efforts and requirements. </p>
        <p><strong>Working in Environmentally Sensitive Areas</strong></p>
        <p>As many of NOV’s customers work in environmentally sensitive areas, it is necessary for the supplied products to meet high standards to protect the areas in which they are used. NOV has developed specific well-control technologies to eliminate the need for hydraulic connections powered by diesel engines when in use by other companies for offshore drilling. Also, NOV provides full closed-loop systems, including solids control equipment, dewatering, water treatment, and power generators, when providing products to customers operating in sensitive areas on land. For example, these systems are in place in parts of Bolivia and in the Situche jungle area of Peru to aid with drill cuttings treatment and management. NOV is constantly working to identify environmentally sensitive areas like these to provide the proper technology to protect these locations.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Within the past few years , we developed systems to track and reduce our energy use. The NOV Energy Use Survey was created specifically to record monthly electricity, natural gas, and fuel usage at every facility and provide an accurate picture of NOV&rsquo;s overall energy consumption and meet global greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements. We will continue to monitor legislation and report as necessary.</p>
        <p>The largest obligation is in the United Kingdom, where energy laws were put into effect under the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC). After much debate, the Environmental Agency, through the CRC, has essentially implemented a tariff on carbon emissions. NOV successfully reported in July 2012 and July 2013 to the UK Environmental Agency and has met all its obligations to the CRC to date.&nbsp; We are continuing to monitor our energy use and implementing reduction measures. In the United States, NOV successfully reported to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Reporting Rule for the facilities that have mandatory obligations by the April 2012 deadline . All facilities in the United States have been evaluated for applicability to regulatory obligations and reported on as necessary. The Australia legislature recently passed the Clean Energy Legislation to track and price greenhouse gas emissions beginning July 1, 2012.</p>
        <h3>Improving energy efficiency</h3>
        <p>In addition to meeting all our greenhouse gas and energy use reporting requirements, we are committed to improving the energy efficiency of our operations. Energy efficiency and green technologies are part of the considerations taken when building new facilities and remodeling older ones. Energy efficiency building requirements and regulations are being met for our new facilities in England and Scotland; these requirements are also being used as recommendations and considerations for new facilities and developments in Brazil, the United States, and other locations in which we operate.</p>
        <p>NOV has also formed a global energy team to perform energy audits on the individual facilities. These energy audits have revealed multiple measures that can be taken across the global enterprise to increase energy efficiency and reduce NOV&rsquo;s overall energy consumption and spending as well as facility-specific reduction opportunities. To perform these energy audits, the corporate energy team works in conjunction with a target facility and analyzes equipment, lighting, HVAC units, and energy consumers to develop a report outlining the facility&rsquo;s largest energy consumers and recommendations for reduction and efficiency improvements. Recommendations range cleaning skylights to allow for brighter facilities and the possibility to eliminate some artificial light use to the purchase of efficient HVAC units or even improved process designs.</p>
        <p>LED lighting uses a fraction of the power that traditional light fixtures use, and improvement in LED technology has enabled NOV to use LED lighting in our manufacturing facilities. Since 2010, NOV has retrofitted numerous facilities in the United States, Canada, and China with LED lighting. Additional, many newly constructed facilities use LED lighting.</p>
        <p>At one of NOV&rsquo;s facilities in Stonehouse, England, engineers and the HSE group teamed up to design a system that would capture waste heat generated by their energy-efficient HVAC units and recycle it back into the building. The system is set to a thermostat, so it only recycles the heat at appropriate times, alleviating the amount of energy needed to heat the building during cold months while eliminating wasted heat generated.</p>
        <h2>Freshwater Management</h2>
        <p>Wastewater treatment and recycle systems installed across the US and Canada allow NOV to conserve water.</p>
        <p>Manufacturing and production activities typically require large quantities of water. Because water is a natural resource, protecting and preserving freshwater supplies involves understanding supply and demand trends at the local level, assessing potential effects on quality and quantity, and implementing steps to appropriately address the challenges. Environmental site assessments are regularly conducted to identify potential risks and create actionable items to improve environmental stewardship. We recognize the need to conserve water resources, and we have developed and implemented a number of technologies to clean industrial water for reuse. Through process improvements and water management awareness, our use of fresh water is lessened, and the volume of generated waste water is reduced. NOV uses wastewater treatment and recycle systems across the US and Canada to conserve water and reduce costs of monitoring and disposal. Implementing automated, self-contained water recycling systems increases efficiency and operations by using automatic controls to adjust pH and oxidizer levels, automatically monitor and backwash filters, and dispense of sludge. These systems produce cleaner water while reducing odor, maintenance costs, and cost of fresh water.</p>
        <p>To maintain compliance with regional and local water specifications and regulations, NOV communicates and cooperates with local officials and agencies regarding storm-water and wastewater generation. At many locations, NOV has installed oil/water separators to capture and treat water used in cleaning and manufacturing operations. These systems are specifically designed to treat waste water to meet or exceed regulatory specifications for release to city or regional water systems. NOV also works closely with wastewater treatment plants by designing specialized pumps to increase plant efficiency as well as pumps for the desalination market.</p>
        <h2>Risk Management</h2>
        <p>Environmental audits are regularly performed on existing facilities to meet regulatory obligations and to meet or exceed industry standards. Due-diligence consists of evaluating locations and sites to analyze their purchase or lease potential.</p>
        <p>Findings from these audits manifest themselves in corrective actions that are intended to reduce potential negative environmental effects and to meet regulatory obligations. For example, NOV is currently working to meet obligations in Alberta, Canada, by installing new fuel tanks with containments as directed by the Petroleum Tank Management Association of Alberta . Also, NOV constantly works to identify and address areas that need containments to proactively manage operational materials. To further protect water discharge areas, NOV has installed several oil/water separators and water treatment systems to reduce the amount of water used annually at our facilities as well as to meet regulatory specifications. Active efforts to contain, minimize, and eliminate sources for spills and contamination have proven to be an essential part of operating efficiently, effectively, and ethically.</p>
        <h2>Waste Management</h2>
        <p>NOV is in the process of transitioning&nbsp; to a proactive model of minimizing waste throughout all facilities. Over the last few years, many NOV facilities have implemented programs to reduce the amount of regulated waste generated by identifying areas for process optimizations and changing materials used in operations. These waste management programs are guided by NOV&rsquo;s efforts for sustainable practices and are also in compliance with regulatory requirements and the cost of disposal that NOV has previously incurred. Regulations and laws governing waste management, disposal, and volumes are identified in the regions in which we operate, and NOV maintains compliance with these obligations. Specific governing agencies and regulations include Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title II annual waste reporting, National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemical Substances (REACH), which all necessitate monitoring and documentation of proper storage and disposal of chemicals and wastes at our facilities. Some of the regulations are state-, city-, or region-specific. For example, if a facility is categorized by the EPA as a &ldquo;Large Quantity Generator&rdquo; or reports a &ldquo;Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Form R&rdquo; chemical in the state of Texas, the facility must produce a Source Reduction/Waste Minimization Plan. These plans outline a 10% reduction within a 5-year period, and NOV continues to meet these requirements.</p>
        <p>To reduce the amount of regulated waste generated, NOV has actively researched and implemented materials that are less hazardous to employees and the environment. In doing so, many facilities have changed from oil-based to water-based solvents.</p>
        <p>Many technologies have also been implemented to reduce waste and emissions. At several facilities, NOV has installed regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTOs), which are used as volatile organic compound (VOC) emission control systems. The RTOs are essential to reducing volatile organic constituents and reducing NOV&rsquo;s overall waste.</p>
        <p>To manage trash, NOV has encouraged and implemented good housekeeping practices, proper storage and containment designs, and recycling streams for solvents, scraps, and paper throughout our facilities. Several NOV facilities have implemented recycling programs that also collect plastics, aluminum cans, cardboards, and other recyclables.</p>
        <p>To protect employees, meet legal obligations, and encourage sustainable practices, training and support are provided on a regular basis by Corporate HSE, the Environmental Risk group, and the individual business unit HSE groups to the operations that fall under waste reporting regulations. As a global company, NOV is continuing to expand the recycling and minimization efforts among our facilities and will be developing and refining the tracking methodology for minimization of several types of waste. NOV&rsquo;s HSE Management System is moving to support waste minimization efforts through electronic benchmarking, measuring, tracking progress, and reporting. Ultimately, NOV will manage all waste information and chemical inventories through our Environmental Management System (EMS) to support our global reporting efforts and requirements. </p>
        <h2>Working in Environmentally Sensitive Areas</h2>
        <p>As many of NOV&rsquo;s customers work in environmentally sensitive areas, it is necessary for the supplied products to meet high standards to protect the areas in which they are used. NOV has developed specific well-control technologies to eliminate the need for hydraulic connections powered by diesel engines when in use by other companies for offshore drilling. Also, NOV provides full closed-loop systems, including solids control equipment, dewatering, water treatment, and power generators, when providing products to customers operating in sensitive areas on land. For example, these systems are in place in parts of Bolivia and in the Situche jungle area of Peru to aid with drill cuttings treatment and management. NOV is constantly working to identify environmentally sensitive areas like these to provide the proper technology to protect these locations.</p>

The Australia legislature recently passed the Clean Energy Legislation to track and price greenhouse gas emissions beginning July 1, 2012.</p>
        <h3>Improving energy efficiency</h3>
        <p>In addition to meeting all our greenhouse gas and energy use reporting requirements, we are committed to improving the energy efficiency of our operations. Energy efficiency and green technologies are part of the considerations taken when building new facilities and remodeling older ones. Energy efficiency building requirements and regulations are being met for our new facilities in England and Scotland; these requirements are also being used as recommendations and considerations for new facilities and developments in Brazil, the United States, and other locations in which we operate.</p>
        <p>NOV has also formed a global energy team to perform energy audits on the individual facilities. These energy audits have revealed multiple measures that can be taken across the global enterprise to increase energy efficiency and reduce NOV&rsquo;s overall energy consumption and spending as well as facility-specific reduction opportunities. To perform these energy audits, the corporate energy team works in conjunction with a target facility and analyzes equipment, lighting, HVAC units, and energy consumers to develop a report outlining the facility&rsquo;s largest energy consumers and recommendations for reduction and efficiency improvements. Recommendations range cleaning skylights to allow for brighter facilities and the possibility to eliminate some artificial light use to the purchase of efficient HVAC units or even improved process designs.</p>
        <p>LED lighting uses a fraction of the power that traditional light fixtures use, and improvement in LED technology has enabled NOV to use LED lighting in our manufacturing facilities. Since 2010, NOV has retrofitted numerous facilities in the United States, Canada, and China with LED lighting. Additional, many newly constructed facilities use LED lighting.</p>
        <p>At one of NOV&rsquo;s facilities in Stonehouse, England, engineers and the HSE group teamed up to design a system that would capture waste heat generated by their energy-efficient HVAC units and recycle it back into the building. The system is set to a thermostat, so it only recycles the heat at appropriate times, alleviating the amount of energy needed to heat the building during cold months while eliminating wasted heat generated.</p>
        <h2>Freshwater Management</h2>
        <p>Wastewater treatment and recycle systems installed across the US and Canada allow NOV to conserve water.</p>
        <p>Manufacturing and production activities typically require large quantities of water. Because water is a natural resource, protecting and preserving freshwater supplies involves understanding supply and demand trends at the local level, assessing potential effects on quality and quantity, and implementing steps to appropriately address the challenges. Environmental site assessments are regularly conducted to identify potential risks and create actionable items to improve environmental stewardship. We recognize the need to conserve water resources, and we have developed and implemented a number of technologies to clean industrial water for reuse. Through process improvements and water management awareness, our use of fresh water is lessened, and the volume of generated waste water is reduced. NOV uses wastewater treatment and recycle systems across the US and Canada to conserve water and reduce costs of monitoring and disposal. Implementing automated, self-contained water recycling systems increases efficiency and operations by using automatic controls to adjust pH and oxidizer levels, automatically monitor and backwash filters, and dispense of sludge. These systems produce cleaner water while reducing odor, maintenance costs, and cost of fresh water.</p>
        <p>To maintain compliance with regional and local water specifications and regulations, NOV communicates and cooperates with local officials and agencies regarding storm-water and wastewater generation. At many locations, NOV has installed oil/water separators to capture and treat water used in cleaning and manufacturing operations. These systems are specifically designed to treat waste water to meet or exceed regulatory specifications for release to city or regional water systems. NOV also works closely with wastewater treatment plants by designing specialized pumps to increase plant efficiency as well as pumps for the desalination market.</p>
        <h2>Risk Management</h2>
        <p>Environmental audits are regularly performed on existing facilities to meet regulatory obligations and to meet or exceed industry standards. Due-diligence consists of evaluating locations and sites to analyze their purchase or lease potential.</p>
        <p>Findings from these audits manifest themselves in corrective actions that are intended to reduce potential negative environmental effects and to meet regulatory obligations. For example, NOV is currently working to meet obligations in Alberta, Canada, by installing new fuel tanks with containments as directed by the Petroleum Tank Management Association of Alberta . Also, NOV constantly works to identify and address areas that need containments to proactively manage operational materials. To further protect water discharge areas, NOV has installed several oil/water separators and water treatment systems to reduce the amount of water used annually at our facilities as well as to meet regulatory specifications. Active efforts to contain, minimize, and eliminate sources for spills and contamination have proven to be an essential part of operating efficiently, effectively, and ethically.</p>
        <h2>Waste Management</h2>
        <p>NOV is in the process of transitioning&nbsp; to a proactive model of minimizing waste throughout all facilities. Over the last few years, many NOV facilities have implemented programs to reduce the amount of regulated waste generated by identifying areas for process optimizations and changing materials used in operations. These waste management programs are guided by NOV&rsquo;s efforts for sustainable practices and are also in compliance with regulatory requirements and the cost of disposal that NOV has previously incurred. Regulations and laws governing waste management, disposal, and volumes are identified in the regions in which we operate, and NOV maintains compliance with these obligations. Specific governing agencies and regulations include Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title II annual waste reporting, National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemical Substances (REACH), which all necessitate monitoring and documentation of proper storage and disposal of chemicals and wastes at our facilities. Some of the regulations are state-, city-, or region-specific. For example, if a facility is categorized by the EPA as a &ldquo;Large Quantity Generator&rdquo; or reports a &ldquo;Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Form R&rdquo; chemical in the state of Texas, the facility must produce a Source Reduction/Waste Minimization Plan. These plans outline a 10% reduction within a 5-year period, and NOV continues to meet these requirements.</p>
        <p>To reduce the amount of regulated waste generated, NOV has actively researched and implemented materials that are less hazardous to employees and the environment. In doing so, many facilities have changed from oil-based to water-based solvents.</p>
        <p>Many technologies have also been implemented to reduce waste and emissions. At several facilities, NOV has installed regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTOs), which are used as volatile organic compound (VOC) emission control systems. The RTOs are essential to reducing volatile organic constituents and reducing NOV&rsquo;s overall waste.</p>
        <p>To manage trash, NOV has encouraged and implemented good housekeeping practices, proper storage and containment designs, and recycling streams for solvents, scraps, and paper throughout our facilities. Several NOV facilities have implemented recycling programs that also collect plastics, aluminum cans, cardboards, and other recyclables.</p>
        <p>To protect employees, meet legal obligations, and encourage sustainable practices, training and support are provided on a regular basis by Corporate HSE, the Environmental Risk group, and the individual business unit HSE groups to the operations that fall under waste reporting regulations. As a global company, NOV is continuing to expand the recycling and minimization efforts among our facilities and will be developing and refining the tracking methodology for minimization of several types of waste. NOV&rsquo;s HSE Management System is moving to support waste minimization efforts through electronic benchmarking, measuring, tracking progress, and reporting. Ultimately, NOV will manage all waste information and chemical inventories through our Environmental Management System (EMS) to support our global reporting efforts and requirements. </p>
        <h2>Working in Environmentally Sensitive Areas</h2>
        <p>As many of NOV&rsquo;s customers work in environmentally sensitive areas, it is necessary for the supplied products to meet high standards to protect the areas in which they are used. NOV has developed specific well-control technologies to eliminate the need for hydraulic connections powered by diesel engines when in use by other companies for offshore drilling. Also, NOV provides full closed-loop systems, including solids control equipment, dewatering, water treatment, and power generators, when providing products to customers operating in sensitive areas on land. For example, these systems are in place in parts of Bolivia and in the Situche jungle area of Peru to aid with drill cuttings treatment and management. NOV is constantly working to identify environmentally sensitive areas like these to provide the proper technology to protect these locations.</p>
