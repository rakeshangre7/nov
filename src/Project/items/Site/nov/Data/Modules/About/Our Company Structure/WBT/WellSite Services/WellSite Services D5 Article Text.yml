        <p>WellSite Services is comprised of four groups&mdash;BRANDT&trade; products, FluidControl, MD Totco, and Site Services&mdash;whose focus is servicing the wellbore and streamlining logistics at the wellsite.</p>
        <p>We design, manufacture, and sell the renowned BRANDT solids control and waste management product lines. Whether they&rsquo;re owned or leased, BRANDT products lower the customer&rsquo;s bottom line by efficiently separating solids and helping reclaim drilling fluids for reuse.</p>
        <p>FluidControl includes our high-performance drilling fluids, completion services, and solids control and waste management solutions. FluidControl experts work at the wellsite to ensure that operators have the hands-on support they need to bring their wells in on time and on budget.</p>
        <p>M/D Totco provides real-time drilling instrumentation, visualization solutions, and data communication to display and store the data needed for any rig operation, while our MPD group provides MPowerD&trade; managed pressure drilling systems, which include chokes, manifolds, and control systems that are fully integrated into the drilling rig.</p>
        <p>Site Services offers an extensive range of resources to help manage the full lifecycle of the wellsite. From land surveying and location build out to water treatment and site remediation, Site Services creates a single point of contact for comprehensive site and logistics management, allowing operators to concentrate valuable resources at the well. Site Services is the home of our Portable Power fleet of generators and temperature control equipment, as well as our Water Services experts and technologies.</p>
