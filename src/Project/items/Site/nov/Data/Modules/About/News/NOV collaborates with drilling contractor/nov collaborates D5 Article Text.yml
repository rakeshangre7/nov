        <p>Using 3D modeling software during the design process, the team developed and tested functional features that helped them build the most efficient, advanced drilling rig while streamlining the manufacturing process. Dubbed &ldquo;The Beast,&rdquo; the world&rsquo;s largest <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3DB00F0F2BDD40C0BD54F81A9AF0FCCB&amp;_z=z">mobile land rig</a>&nbsp;features 12 modules, each of which offers the latest drilling and safety technologies. Boasting a relatively small footprint, the rig will be able to drill some of the longest laterals in the world from a single well pad.</p>
        <p>Doyon 26 will soon be put to the test, as it will be used on an Alaskan Slope drilling campaign for a major operator this year. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.worldoil.com/magazine/2019/december-2019/features/unique-collaboration-produces-landmark-rig-design" target="_blank">Read the full feature article in the December issue of World Oil to learn how Doyon 26 went from concept to an impressive example of drilling rig innovation.&nbsp;</a></p>
