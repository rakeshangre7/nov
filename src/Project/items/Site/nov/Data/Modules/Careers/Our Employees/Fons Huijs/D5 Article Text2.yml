        <h2>Changing winds: A new direction in energy</h2>
        <p>As Fons&rsquo; work shifts more toward offshore wind technology, he&rsquo;s motivated by the fast-paced expansion of wind energy and the opportunity to be part of a global energy transition that reduces carbon emissions. Just a little more than a decade ago, a client was happy to have five 5-MW wind turbines installed within a few months. Now, vessels designed by GustoMSC can install one 10-MW turbine in a day.</p>
        <p>As the global winds blow toward a greener future with less use of carbon-burning fuels and more application of alternative energies, Fons sees this as an opportunity for major oil and gas companies to pave the way. &ldquo;For the long-term solution, we should invest in technology for renewable energy, because that&rsquo;s where a lot of growth is. It&rsquo;s an opportunity [for NOV] to use our experience from offshore oil and gas in a new area.&rdquo; So, it&rsquo;s not one energy source competing against the other. Rather, oil and gas companies are among the top organizations driving the expansion and innovation of alternative energies.</p>
        <p>Like many others, Fons is excited about NOV&rsquo;s decision to take a new direction and invest in companies such as GustoMSC that are active in offshore wind.</p>
