        <h2>Hookup Upgrades</h2>
        
        <p>With drilling programs that require longer wells and bigger casing strings, we are ready with custom hookload upgrades suited to upgrade your hookload. We know the market is looking for rigs that can drill faster and deeper than ever before, and NOV’s hookload upgrades are designed to take you there.</p>
        
        <p>Bring your rig into the conversation: Rigs with 1500 ton hookloads have a utilization rate higher than those at 1250 tons and below. Your rig may be an eligible candidate for an upgrade.</p>
