        <p>Our wide range of tapered shaft, prestressed concrete lighting poles provide many color and surface options suitable for street lighting, recreational areas, parking lots, shipping centers, park security, greenbelts, and walkways.</p>
        <p>Ameron&trade; round, square, and octagonal poles are symmetrically tapered, prestressed, and spun-cast concrete poles designed for ultimate strength and durability. They are available in base plate and embedded installation styles. Surface treatments and top sealers are also available to enhance colors, protect the concrete surface, and aid in the removal of graffiti.</p>
        <p>Our Centrecon line is manufactured in two strategically positioned manufacturing facilities, while our Contemporary line is made at our facility in California. No matter where you are in the country, we'll leverage our national manufacturing footprint to get you the pole you need on-time and on-budget.</p>
        <p>Our Ameron poles are available in round, square, octagonal, and hexagonal shapes and are organized by height and strength.</p>
