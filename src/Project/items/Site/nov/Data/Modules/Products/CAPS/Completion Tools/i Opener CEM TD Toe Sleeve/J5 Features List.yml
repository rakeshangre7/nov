      Hint: description
      Value: |
        <p>The i-Opener™ CEM TD is used as a time- and cost-saving alternative to conventional toe perforating methods and in applications requiring multiple pressure cycles and full casing pressure testing. In multistage frac applications, the i-Opener CEM TD can hydraulically frac the first stage and/or establish injectivity, allowing frac balls or plugs to be pumped to the lower completion. The time delay mechanics in the i-Opener CEM TD can be tailored to fit each application to allow for short or long opening delays in a wide range of pressures and temperatures. This capability allows for an unlimited number of high-pressure cycles, in heavy fluids, to be performed without operating the i-Opener. After the required high-pressure operations are completed, the i-Opener CEM TD can be opened at lower pressure, even in lighter fluids when required.</p>
        
        <p>The unique features of the i-Opener CEM TD allow for multiple hydraulic pressure events in the well to set liner hanger and for pressure testing the liner and/or upper completion without risking premature opening of the toe.</p>
        
        <p>The i-Opener CEM TD is designed to allow validation testing according to ISO 14998, V0 rating, making it suitable for wells in which the lower completion is required to be part of the well barrier.</p>
