        <p>The VectorEDGE&trade; rotary steerable system (RSS) is the first tool of its kind designed for performance drilling in vertical, lateral, and 3D profiles in unconventional wells. Operators and directional drillers can now receive the benefits and cost efficiencies provided by the tool&rsquo;s unique, fit-for-purpose design.</p>
        <p>The VectorEDGE RSS is a simple, cost-effective, 3D push-the-bit RSS that provides full directional drilling control of the wellbore under full rotation of the drill string. The system has various configurations with different tool-face settings (1&deg; increments) and aggressivity settings (1% increments) for directional adjustment. The VectorEDGE system also has a closed-loop control system capable of making automatic adjustments to maintain the current wellbore inclination or continuously seek vertical. The VectorEDGE is currently available in 6&frac12;-in. size, which is suitable in 7⅞- to 8&frac34;-in. hole sizes.</p>
