            <li>Allows operations as a regular total gas detector and can be selected to export C1 through C5.
            </li>
            <li>Uses a state-of-the art infrared spectrometer calibrated for real-life gas mixtures to isolate each hydrocarbon type out of a mixture every second with the accuracy of a gas chromatograph.
            </li>
            <li>Wetness, balance, and character ratio formulas are processed and exported every second, providing ratio values and ratio signatures in real time while drilling.
            </li>
            <li>Gas ratio profiles support directional drillers decision to adjust the bit&rsquo;s well path by geosteering to the target hydrocarbon fluid state profile, maximizing target production.
            </li>
            <li>Wireless data is encrypted and secure.
            </li>
            <li>Reduces risk to personnel by removing sample poly line from shaker to geologist/mudlogger shack.</li>
            <li>Engineered in a rig tough explosion-proof approved enclosure.
            </li>
            <li>Wireless communications, quick connect electrical connections, elimination of gas sample tubing, and a rugged yet lightweight unit (35 lb.) significantly reduce rig-up time.
            </li>
            <li>Status lights let rig personnel know when the unit is initializing, heating up, operating properly, or gas sample flow line is plugged.
            </li>
            <li>Internal diagnostics monitor and send alarms when any operational issues are detected. </li>
            <li>Units are remotely accessed daily to ensure unit uptime.
            </li>
            <li>Gas Watch Analyzer is reliable and gas data repeatable.

      Value: "<p>The M/D Totco™ Gas Watch™ Analyzer is the oil and gas industry’s most innovative, versatile, and easy-to-use gas detection system. The GWA can isolates methane (C1), ethane (C2), propane (C3), butane (C4), and pentane (C5) gas values then calculates them into a total gas value for a more accurate total gas reading versus older technologies. Wetness, balance, and character ratio formulas are processed and exported every second to the EDR, providing ratio values and ratio signatures in real-time while drilling.</p>"
