        <p>The M/D Totco&trade; Engine Monitoring solution provides a window into your engine&rsquo;s usage, making blind operations a thing of the past. Engine data is captured and transferred in real-time to our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2322D23CAE844EC4B9CC72BB3DF53EDB&amp;_z=z">RigSense&trade; EDR</a>, where it is correlated with drilling data. Key engine data can be displayed directly on the strip chart so that engine efficiency can be evaluated in correlation with the rig&rsquo;s current activity. Easily monitor engine efficiency and health benchmarks by setting alarms at rig-site or in the office via our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=64D391F9C88E45B196EE2CDE6F242885&amp;_z=z">WellData&trade; RT</a>&nbsp;remote monitoring platform. You will be instantly notified either on the screen or via email when an alarm has been triggered so immediate action can be taken. With optimal engine loading and fuel consumption monitoring, the number of unscheduled maintenance events are substantially lowered, helping both the drilling contractor and operator.</p>
