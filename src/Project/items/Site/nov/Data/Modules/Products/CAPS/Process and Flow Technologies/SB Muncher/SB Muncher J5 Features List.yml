      Hint: description
      Value: |
        <p>Designed as an effective sewage grinder and to replace high-speed macerators, the SB Muncher can save up to 85% of the energy requirements of a centrifugal force system. Typically, it has a cutting tip speed 90% less than a high-speed macerator system and also much lower vibration and noise levels.</p>
        <p>Being of a compact size for the smaller-capacity flows, the unit operates as an independent unit for open-channel or pipeline configuration. When combined with our transfer pump, the package provides a highly efficient sewage pumping system.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>ETOS cutters offer positive and effective solids maceration</li>
            <li>Cantilever shaft design with no bottom bearings or seals to minimize maintenance costs</li>
            <li>Low cutter tip speeds ensure power is not wasted in water horsepower and abrasive wear rates are minimized</li>
            <li>Low speed also results in lower noise and vibration levels</li>
            <li>One-piece cutter/box bearing housing to provide a simple, compact construction</li>
            <li>3-year warranty on raw sewage applications for pipeline units</li>
            <li>Each muncher is supplied with a programmable logic controller (PLC) to protect the machine against damage and overloads</li>
            <li>Munchers can be supplied to comply with the ATEX Directive 94/9/EC</li>
        </ul>
