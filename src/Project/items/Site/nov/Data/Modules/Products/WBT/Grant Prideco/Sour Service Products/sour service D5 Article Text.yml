        <h2>Advanced Sour Service Grade Drill Pipe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HS<sup>3</sup>&trade; 125</strong> provides an extra 19% tensile capacity compared to that of previous 105-ksi Specified Minimum Yield Strength (SMYS) commercial grades. The controlled yield tool joints have the same strength that API specifies, delivering the full connection torque capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>XS<sup>2</sup>&trade; 95</strong> offers a completely SSC-resistant intervention and completion string. Intervention systems operate in environments that cannot always be controlled, and prolonged exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S may occur. With a weld area that is SSC-resistant, XS<sup>2</sup> 95 saves time and money in deepwater applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Commercial Sour Service Grade Drill Pipe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>XD&trade; Grade</strong> is designed for the most severe H<sub>2</sub>S environments. Our XD grades feature restricted yield tool joints and a NACE TM0177 Method A tested tube for optimum fracture toughness, controlled yield strength, and restricted hardness. It is available in XD 95 and XD 105 with respective 95- and 105-ksi tube SMYS.</li>
            <li><strong>TSS&trade; Grade</strong> is a variation of our XD product, featuring a NACE-tested tube and API tool joints with an SMYS of 120-ksi. It is typically used in drilling applications in which connection strength is required and H<sub>2</sub>S embrittlement is well mitigated. We offer TSS 95 and TSS 105 with respective 95- and 105-ksi tube SMYS.</li>

        <h2>&nbsp; Customized Sour Service Grade Drill Pipe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CYX&trade;</strong> is a family of grades that enable end users to customize the drill pipe used to deliver their wells by changing a limited number of parameters: SMYS of tube or tool joints and the option to NACE test or not. Contact your Grant Prideco representative to further discuss your specific needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>&nbsp; Sour Service Grades for Heavy Weight Drill Pipe (HWDP)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>XD&trade; 90</strong> is an ideal solution for sour service environments in which wear resistance, weight, and flexibility are required. Available for standard and spiral products, XD 90 material features a tempered martensitic microstructure for enhanced fracture toughness along with a controlled yield strength and restricted hardness.</li>

        <h2>IRP Sour Service Grade Drill Pipe and HWDP</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SS Grade</strong> is specifically designed and manufactured to meet stringent Canadian IRP requirements. These special alloy materials combine reduced carbon chemistries with advanced quench-and-temper processes for optimal SSC resistance, even in highly concentrated H<sub>2</sub>S environments.</li>
