        <p>Numerous independent studies have shown that In all Kenics KM Series static mixers, a patented helical mixing element directs the flow of material radially toward the pipe walls and back to the center. Additional velocity reversal and flow division results from combining alternating right- and left-hand elements, thus increasing mixing efficiency. All material is continuously and completely mixed, eliminating radial gradients in temperature, velocity, and material composition.</p>
        <p><strong>Mixing Applications&nbsp;<br />
        </strong><br />
        <strong>Turbulent blending</strong><br />
        The KM static mixer produces rapid mixing by inducing circular patterns that reverse direction at each element intersection.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Laminar blending</strong><br />
        The alternating helical elements of the KM static mixer continually divide, stretch, and reorient the flow stream to produce complete mixing with minimum pressure drop.</p>
        <div><strong>Liquid/liquid dispersion</strong><br />
        The uniform turbulent shear field of the KM static mixer quickly disperses immiscible liquids and produces a narrow drop size distribution.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Gas liquid dispersion</strong><br />
        Gases can be incorporated into turbulent liquids using the KM static mixer. Mass transfer rates are dramatically enhanced to maximize absorption or reaction.</div>
        <p><strong>Extrusion</strong><br />
        A special line of KM style mixers, called Thermogenizers, are available to blend thermal gradients as well as supplemental color and additive blending.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Numerous independent studies have shown that In all&nbsp;Kenics&trade;&nbsp;KM Series static mixers, a patented helical mixing element directs the flow of material radially toward the pipe walls and back to the center. Additional velocity reversal and flow division results from combining alternating right- and left-hand elements, thus increasing mixing efficiency. All material is continuously and completely mixed, eliminating radial gradients in temperature, velocity, and material composition.</p>
        <h4><strong>Mixing Applications&nbsp;</strong></h4>
        <strong>Turbulent blending</strong>
        <p>
        The KM static mixer produces rapid mixing by inducing circular patterns that reverse direction at each element intersection.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Laminar blending</strong></p>
        <p>
        The alternating helical elements of the KM static mixer continually divide, stretch, and reorient the flow stream to produce complete mixing with minimum pressure drop.</p>
