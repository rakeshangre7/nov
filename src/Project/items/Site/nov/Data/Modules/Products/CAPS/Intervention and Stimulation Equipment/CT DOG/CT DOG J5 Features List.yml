        <h2>Detect imperfections while coiled tubing is running in or out</h2>
        <p>A microprocessor in the digital display unit analyzes the measurements and displays ovality as well as minimum, maximum, and average diameters. These data are also available through an RS232 interface to our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DE578BE101EA44B0B383972F9BF72701&amp;_z=z">Orion™ data acquisition system</a>&nbsp;or other computers. The CT-DOG is made up of a sensor head with 12 probes, a dual-function cable for power and data transmission, an operator interface and signal processing module, and the power supply.</p>
        
        <h2>Principle of operation</h2>
        <p>The cylindrical sensor head surrounding the coiled tubing contains three rings, each with four eddy current proximity probes in a radial array. The 90° spacing between the radials gives six OD measurements with 30° spacing around the coiled tubing. The sensing element of each probe faces the work string in the center of the ring, and each probe measures the distance from its face to the surface of the coiled tubing. Two diametrically opposite probes form a measurement pair. For a given measurement pair, the difference between the probe-to-probe spacing and the sum of these gap measurements is the OD. Thus, each ring provides two orthogonal diameters and a measure of the ovality of the coiled tubing cross-section. Ovality is twice the difference of the two diameters divided by their sum: 2 × (ODmax - ODmin)/( ODmax + ODmin).
        The cylindrical sensor head splits lengthwise in a manner that allows it to close around the work string. Thus, CT-DOG can be installed on the coiled tubing between the reel and injector head at any time during operations. The sensor head attaches rigidly to the reel-level wind. A single cable connects the sensor head to the remotely located operator interface and signal processing module.</p>
