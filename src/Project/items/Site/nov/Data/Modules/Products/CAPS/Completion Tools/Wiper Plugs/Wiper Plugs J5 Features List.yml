      Hint: description
      Value: |
        <p>We provide both single-wiper plug (SWP) and duo-wiper plug (DWP) offerings that serve as a barrier between cement and mud, thereby preventing cement contamination and improving wiping efficiency. Our dart and plug systems are fit for purpose across a wide range of wellbore environments and in a wide range of cemented liner applications including subsea, extended reach, and multistage cementing applications with our PureFlow&trade; stage cementing tool.</p>
        <h2>Single-wiper plug</h2>
        <p>The SWP with integrated ball seat is attached to the setting tool and located in the first liner casing joint below the liner hanger. The hydraulic liner hanger is activated by closing the ball seat with the setting ball. Increasing pressure shears the setting ball with the ball seat and pumps it into the catcher underneath the wiper plug. Once released from surface behind the pumped cement, the drill pipe dart wipes the drill pipe with enhanced wiping efficiency and releases the SWP, which is then jointly pumped with the drill pipe dart and continues to wipe the liner until reaching the landing collar. The dart and SWP serve as a barrier between the cement and mud to reduce cement contamination, ensure cement integrity, and optimize wiping efficiency of the drill pipe and the liner. The SWP with ball seat interlocks in the landing collar and enables optimized drillout times.</p>
        <h3 class="J5-features-list__headline">Features/benefits</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Ball seat located in the wiper plug reduces shock loading of the formation</li>
        <li>Saves time due to reduced ball travel</li>
        <li>High-strength design enables high bump pressure</li>
        <li>Anti-rotating mechanism to reduce drillout time</li>
        <li>Reliable and simple release mechanism</li>
        <li>Enhanced wiping efficiency</li>
        <li>Prevent/reduce cement contamination and improve cement integrity</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Duo-wiper plug</h2>
        <p>Designed with optimized wiping efficiencies and reduced drillout times, the field-proven DWP system ensures a bilateral separation of the cement column in the drill pipe and liner, allowing for complete separation of the cement column to further prevent cement contamination and improve cement integrity. The system is attached to the setting tool and placed in the first liner casing joint below the liner hanger. The lower part of the DWP is released by the first drill pipe dart and pumped to the landing collar, where an anti-rotation mechanism interlocks with the landing collar. By the landing on the landing collar, a short pressure increase takes place and the cement can be displaced further. The upper part of the DWP is released by a second drill pipe dart and pumped down to the landing collar (limit stop). The DWP interlocks in the landing collar, allowing an optimized drillout.</p>
        <h3 class="J5-features-list__headline">Features/benefits</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>No contamination of the cement with mud</li>
        <li>Simple and reliable duo-wiper plug system</li>
        <li>Emergency release feature for the top plug</li>
        <li>No risk of a stuck inner sleeve of the top wiper plug</li>
        <li>High-strength design allows high bump pressure</li>
        <li>Anti-rotating mechanism to reduce drillout time</li>
        </ul>
