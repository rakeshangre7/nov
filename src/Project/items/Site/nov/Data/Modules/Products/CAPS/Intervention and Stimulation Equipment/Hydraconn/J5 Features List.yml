        It has a tapered seal bore that allows the connector to mate even when the injector is suspended at a slight angle. The Hydraconn is operated by a single hydraulic line that opens a series of latching dogs on the BOP-mounted connector half to accept the stinger sub-mounted on the bottom of the stripper packer. Once the two parts are stabbed together, the hydraulic pressure is vented, and the spring-loaded system forces the latch dogs closed, locking the Hydraconn together.</p>
