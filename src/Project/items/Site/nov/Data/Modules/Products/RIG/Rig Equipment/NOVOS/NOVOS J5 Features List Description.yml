        <h2>What is NOVOS?</h2>
        <p>We provide the technical expertise, advanced equipment and operational support our customers in the oil and gas industry need to succeed. We have the people, capabilities and vision to serve the needs of a challenging and evolving industry.</p>
        <p><strong>The driller oversees the process and can easily take control if desired.</strong></p>
        <p>NOVOS™ is the industry’s only reflexive drilling system, automating repetitive drilling activities, benefiting contractors by allowing drillers to focus on consistent process execution and safety, and benefiting operators by optimizing drilling programs.</p>
        <h2>What Is a “Reflexive Drilling System”?</h2>
        <p>A reflexive drilling system is designed to perform a series of actions when prompted, just as human reflex respond when acted upon by a specific stimulus. The NOVOS reflexive drilling system is easily scalable and can augment existing people and processes for greater control, consistency and enhanced performance, or expand all the way to full closed-loop automation.</p>
        <h2>NOVOS Advantages</h2>
        <p>NOVOS provides control and consistency for any operation. It allows drillers to automate repetitive drilling activities, such as making a connection (offshore), coming off and on bottom, with specific parameters for circulation, weight-on-bit and more. The result is greater consistency, with every driller – regardless of individual experience level – able to achieve the same improved performance time and time again.</p>
        <h3>Precise Control</h3>
        <p>Set the exact parameters to meet the needs of your drilling program, from circulation to weight-on-bit and everything in between, and the NOVOS system performs at the push of a button.</p>
        <h3>Unmatched Consistency</h3>
        <p>Regardless of who’s at the controls, the NOVOS system offers the same performance, again and again, eliminating NPT and protecting your equipment.</p>
        <h3>Increased Performance</h3>
        <p>With more consistency comes greater performance. Because the reflexive system automates repetitive tasks, you’ll achieve better average performance throughout the entire drilling lifecycle, regardless of the experience level of the driller.</p>
        <h3>Infinite Customization</h3>
        <p>With additional off-the-shelf apps that can be tailored to your needs or completely custom designs, the NOVOS system can be updated to meet specific needs with just a bit of software.</p>
        <h3>Minimal Interruption</h3>
        <p>The whole system can be installed in 12 hours and requires limited additional hardware.</p>
