        <p>Smart Drilling GmbH is now part of NOV, and the RSS tools are now offered through NOV ReedHycalog as the VectorZIEL and VectorEXAKT products&mdash;formerly known as the Smart Drilling Scout and ZBE tools, respectively. You can visit our German language website at smart-drilling.de or find more details below.</p>
        <p>The VectorZIEL&trade; RSS is an automatic steering tool for three-dimensional drilling. Offering a higher rate of penetration, improved cuttings removal, and precise trajectory control, the system helps you produce higher-quality boreholes at reduced operational costs.</p>
        <p>We have developed and refined a premium rotary steerable system (RSS) over the course of the past two decades, culminating in the release of the VectorZIEL system. The VectorZIEL system offers reliable and precise directional control in even the most demanding drilling applications. The system is available for purchase or rent and is supported by NOV's global maintenance infrastructure, enabling directional drillers to offer high-tier directional drilling services around the world.</p>
