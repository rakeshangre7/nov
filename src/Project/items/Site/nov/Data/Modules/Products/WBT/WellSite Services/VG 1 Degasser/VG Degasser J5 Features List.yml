        <h2>Maximizing efficiency, operation, safety, and maintenance</h2>
        <p>Our VG degassers efficiently and effectively remove gases from gas-cut mud. This ensures the proper mud weight is pumped downhole and aids in the prevention of blowouts. In addition, the VG-1 degasser improves the performance of surface mud systems and increases operational safety by removing most entrained gasses in drilling fluids immediately downstream of the shakers and upstream of any centrifugal pumps. VG degassers are engineered and manufactured to provide years of reliable service.</p>
        <p>The VG-1 is a horizontally skid-mounted, high-efficiency degasser with a Class I, Div. 1 starter and motor. The external JP-10 jet pump system pulls the gas-cut mud into the degasser and spreads it over the internal dispersion plate in thin layers, separating gas bubbles from the drilling mud. A vacuum pump mounted on the skid then pulls the gas out of the degasser to be piped away for safe venting or flaring. Liquid levels are regulated by a float assembly to ensure the vessel maintains a safe operating capacity. </p>

            <li>Interior components coated with corrosion-resistant cold-tar epoxy for long part life with minimum maintenance</li>
            <li>Float-regulated liquid level in the degasser chamber ensures system will not overfill or run dry</li>
            <li>High-performance educator pulls mud into degasser, eliminating gas locking and allowing the degassed mud to be discharged up to 20 ft (6 m) away, thus simplifying installation</li>
            <li>Skid-mounted vacuum pump protects vacuum unit from damage and enables simple maintenance</li>
            <li>Fail-safe secondary float and filler keeps mud from entering the vacuum pump</li>
            <li>Dispersion plates create thin sheets of gas-cut mud and bring entrained gas closer to the mud surface for easy removal</li>
            <li>Horizontally mounted unit fits in areas where head space is at a premium
            <ul>
                <li>Able to process 1,000 gal/min (3785 L/min) of mud</li>
