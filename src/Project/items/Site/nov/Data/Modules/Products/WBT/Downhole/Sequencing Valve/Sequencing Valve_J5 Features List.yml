      Hint: description
      Value: |
        <p>The Cement Valve is a check valve designed to support a column of fluid until an increase in pressure is applied to the column from above. Once the increased pressure is seen at the valve, it will open, and the column of fluid will be allowed to flow through the valve. By reducing pressure to the column of fluid to its original level, the valve will close, and the fluid will cease to flow.</p>
        
        <p>As pressure is applied to the column of fluid, it identifies the selected cross-sectional area and begins to compress the disc springs. The disc springs are compressed, holding the piston nose on seat and preventing the from traveling through the tool. Pressure acting on the piston</p>
        
        <p>When the pressure is increased, the force acting on the piston the fluid  bypasses the piston seat and travels down the tool.</p>
        
        <p>The cement valve can be reconfigured to operate at different pressures in a range from 500 psi.</p>
        
        <p>The cement valve was originally developed as a control valve capable of accurately delivering cement during coiled tubing cementing operations. The same tool can also be used to deliver any fluid downhole using the same principle.</p>

        <p>The flow-activated sequencing valve is a normally open valve that allows circulation through the tool to the annulus, while running into the well. Once a predetermined differential pressure is exceeded, the flow path to the annulus is closed and diverted into the internal bore of the tool string, thereby enabling hydraulic activation of any tools in the lower and upper ends of the tool string.</p>
        <p>When pulling a tool string out of the well, a sequencing valve can be used to safely bleed off internal coil pressure. When the coil pressure is decreased to a predetermined pressure, the Sequencing Valve opens and allows bleed through its bypass ports. Therefore, during bleed-down the internal/external pressures are balanced, eliminating the possibility of prematurely releasing flow-activated manipulation tools in the lubricator.</p>
        <p>The closing differential pressure of the sequencing valve can be field adjusted to between 500 to 2,000 psi.</p>

      Hint: description
      Value: |
        <p>The flow-activated sequencing valve is a normally open valve that allows circulation through the tool to the annulus while running into the well. Once a predetermined differential pressure is exceeded, the flow path to the annulus is closed and diverted into the internal bore of the tool string, thereby enabling hydraulic activation of any tools in the lower and upper ends of the tool string.</p>
        <p>When pulling a tool string out of the well, a sequencing valve can be used to safely bleed off internal coil pressure. When the coil pressure is decreased to a predetermined pressure, the sequencing valve opens and allows bleed through its bypass ports. Therefore, during bleed-down the internal/external pressures are balanced, eliminating the possibility of prematurely releasing flow-activated manipulation tools in the lubricator.</p>
        <p>The closing differential pressure of the sequencing valve can be field adjusted to between 500 to 2,000 psi.</p>
        <p>When ordering sequencing valves, please specify size and thread connection</p>
