        <p>NOV&rsquo;s FloSurvey&trade; real-time survey tool capitalizes on the success of our proven FloDrift&trade; product, which features our patented Pressure Release Encoding System (PRES&trade;) technology for easy, cost-effective transmission of downhole information. <br />
        <br />
        The FloSurvey tool provides real-time surveys during the normal operation of making a connection, saving you both rig time and money. The FloSurvey tool is less expensive than a full measurement while drilling (MWD) system, and our approach offers improvements in performance and safety compared to traditional wireline surveys.</p>
        <p>Our FloSurvey tool further extends the PRES and FloDrift technologies, displaying inclination and azimuth in less than 90 seconds from pumps on&mdash;the fastest real-time azimuth decoding in the industry. Additionally, PRES technology works well in noisy surface-hole sections, unlike most MWD decoders that struggle to provide accurate measurements in noisy environments. <br />
        <br />
        The FloSurvey tool automatically compensates for most flow-rate and mud-density changes, allowing operators to change mud flow and weights without affecting decoding performance. Memory-logged survey data can be processed after the tool is back on the surface if additional quality assurance or enhanced survey accuracy is required. The FloSurvey surface decoder uses a small footprint computer and a user-friendly touchscreen display that automatically detect, decode, and display survey inclination and azimuth. All real-time transmitted surveys and well survey logs are viewable on the drill floor, and the data are obtainable for printing anytime.</p>
