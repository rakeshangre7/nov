        <p>The proven TK line of IPCs consistently sets the industry standard for corrosion and wear prevention, improving hydraulic efficiency, and controlling deposit mitigation.</p>
        <p>Our extensive line of TK coatings is designed to address the operating needs of every type of oilfield environment.</p>
        <h2>Drill pipe coatings</h2>
        <p>TK coatings extend the life of your drill pipe and improve drill string performance in even the most aggressive downhole environments, enduring all temperatures commonly encountered during drilling when circulation is maintained.</p>
        <p>Our internal TK drill pipe coatings prevent corrosion, pitting, and associated fatigue that can result in washouts and twist-offs, which shut down drilling operations. Coated pipe also reduces friction, increases hydraulic efficiencies, and helps eliminate the build-up of harmful scale deposits.</p>
        <p>To extend the longevity of the drill string, we recommend frequent drill pipe coating evaluations.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Tube-Kote production coatings</h2>
        <p>Production tubing is constantly exposed to harsh downhole conditions, making protection against corrosion and wear essential. Using the appropriate Tube-Kote IPC will increase production, decrease downtime, and extend the lifespan of tubulars. Our expansive line of TK coatings is purposefully designed to address your individual well conditions.</p>
        <h2>Line pipe coatings</h2>
        <p>TK coatings are used across a wide range of environments (H2S, CO2, etc.) in line pipe applications, providing maximum corrosion protection with improved hydraulic efficiency and flow assurance across a broad range of temperatures.</p>
        <p>For accurate coating selection, contact your Tuboscope representative for a coating evaluation.</p>
