        <p>The Discreen design is self-cleaning and does not require manual raking or cleaning. The screen is constructed using a number of shafts, each fitted with discs that overlap and intermesh with corresponding shafts. The shaft rotation forms a gentle conveying action of solids across the face of the screen to the discharge point while allowing water to flow through the disc stacks. Individual comb bars are fitted to the first and last shaft to eject screening solids for discharge back into the main flow or sump area.</p>
