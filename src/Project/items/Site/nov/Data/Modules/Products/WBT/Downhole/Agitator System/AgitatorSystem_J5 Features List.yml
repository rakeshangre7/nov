        <p>Combining the Agitator tool and a shock tool, the Agitator system reduces downhole friction and improves weight transfer to the bit by introducing an axial oscillating motion to keep the drill string moving. The result is higher rate of penetration (ROP), enhanced toolface control, and reduced stick-slip in all modes of drilling, whether sliding or rotating. The Agitator system has shown benefits in all well profiles and is compatible with all downhole motors, rotary steerable systems, and measurement while drilling or logging while drilling (MWD/LWD) systems with pre-job planning.</p>
        
        <p>The power section in our Agitator system is used in a completely different manner than a power section in a mud motor, which can be susceptible to chunking issues. Because the rotor in the Agitator tool spins freely with virtually no torque load, the elastomer power section experiences very little loading and has proven to be 99.9% reliable.</p>
        
        <p>In fishing applications, the high-frequency axial oscillations of our Agitator system can help to free stuck objects, improving the efficiency of standard fishing tools in the bottomhole assembly (BHA).</p>
