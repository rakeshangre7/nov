        <p>Using the seabed for treatment of raw seawater, the Seabox module provides a flexible approach to getting more out of a reservoir. Seabox is a tool to improve sweep efficiency and for pretreatment for processing equipment to alter water chemistry in combination with either topside or subsea processing equipment.</p>
        <p>With our water treatment technology able to be integrated to fit operators’ requirements, our solutions range from topside, subsea, or a combination of both. Our ability to tailor a water treatment solution to a field as an easy add-on any time in the field's life allows for flexible drainage strategies. Through the Seabox module and the different SWIT™ subsea water treatment applications, we can offer everything from purely disinfected, raw seawater as pretreatment to topside facilities to full-fledged subsea low-sulfate and low-salinity solutions for water injection.</p>

        <p>Using the seabed for treatment of raw seawater, the Seabox module provides a flexible approach to getting more out of a reservoir. Seabox is a tool to improve sweep efficiency and for pretreatment for processing equipment to alter water chemistry in combination with either topside or subsea processing equipment.</p>
        <p>With our water treatment technology able to be integrated to fit operators&rsquo; requirements, our solutions range from topside, subsea, or a combination of both. Our ability to tailor a water treatment solution to a field as an easy add-on any time in the field's life allows for flexible drainage strategies. Through the Seabox module and the different SWIT&trade; subsea water treatment applications, we can offer everything from purely disinfected, raw seawater as pretreatment to topside facilities to full-fledged subsea low-sulfate and low-salinity solutions for water injection.</p>
        <p>The Seabox module enables an optimum water flooding regime and is based on the principles of electrolysis and gravitational separation.<br />
        <br />
        The Seabox module uses electro-chlorination and hydroxyl radicals to eliminate bacteria, and a large chamber allows for 99% settlement of inorganic particles larger than 8.5 &mu;m. We&rsquo;ve moved water treatment to the seabed, where the 8 &times; 8 &times; 8-m Seabox module with a nominal capacity of 40,000 b/d treats surrounding seawater to superior quality for injection into oil reservoirs.</p>
        <p>The Seabox module consist of three parts: tray, still room, and treatment unit&mdash;where all structures can be made of fiber-reinforced polymer. The tray is the base structure of the modules and has a chamber to collect settled out particles; the still room is a settlement tank that ensures an effective chlorine soak to disinfect water and to settle out suspended solids. Both the still room and the tray will stay on the seabed&mdash;either until end of field life or until moved to another injection wellsite.</p>
        <p>All critical components with an operational lifetime such as the electrochemical processes as well as the module&rsquo;s power and control system are placed in the treatment unit. Intervention intervals are expected to take place every 4 to 5 years, when the 9-ton treatment unit&mdash;the size of a 40-ft container&mdash;will be retrieved in its entirety.</p>
        <p>The Seabox module is qualified for water depths down to 3000 m.</p>

        <p>Using the seabed for treatment of raw seawater, the Seabox™ module provides a flexible approach to getting more out of a reservoir. Seabox is a tool to improve sweep efficiency and for pretreatment for processing equipment to alter water chemistry in combination with either topside or subsea processing equipment.</p>
        <p>With our water treatment technology able to be integrated to fit operators’ requirements, our solutions range from topside, subsea, or a combination of both. Our ability to tailor a water treatment solution to a field as an easy add-on any time in the field's life allows for flexible drainage strategies. Through the Seabox module and the different SWIT™ subsea water treatment applications, we can offer everything from purely disinfected, raw seawater as pretreatment to topside facilities to full-fledged subsea low-sulfate and low-salinity solutions for water injection.</p>
        <p>The Seabox module enables an optimum water flooding regime and is based on the principles of electrolysis and gravitational separation.<br />
        <br />
        The Seabox module uses electro-chlorination and hydroxyl radicals to eliminate bacteria, and a large chamber allows for 99% settlement of inorganic particles larger than 8.5 μm. We’ve moved water treatment to the seabed, where the 8 × 8 × 8-m Seabox module with a nominal capacity of 40,000 b/d treats surrounding seawater to superior quality for injection into oil reservoirs.</p>
        <p>The Seabox module consist of three parts: tray, still room, and treatment unit—where all structures can be made of fiber-reinforced polymer. The tray is the base structure of the modules and has a chamber to collect settled out particles; the still room is a settlement tank that ensures an effective chlorine soak to disinfect water and to settle out suspended solids. Both the still room and the tray will stay on the seabed—either until end of field life or until moved to another injection wellsite.</p>
        <p>All critical components with an operational lifetime such as the electrochemical processes as well as the module’s power and control system are placed in the treatment unit. Intervention intervals are expected to take place every 4 to 5 years, when the 9-ton treatment unit—the size of a 40-ft container—will be retrieved in its entirety.</p>
        <p>The Seabox module is qualified for water depths down to 3000 m.</p>
