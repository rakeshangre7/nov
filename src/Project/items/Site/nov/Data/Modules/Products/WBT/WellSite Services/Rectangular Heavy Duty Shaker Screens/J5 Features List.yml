        <p>The BRANDT&trade; Rectangular Heavy-Duty (RHD) line of shaker screens uses two layers of heavy-duty rectangular mesh and one layer of coarse mesh to produce a durable and effective screening media. This combination of screen media provides users with enhanced liquid conductance, which allows for a higher throughput of fluids. RHD series screens also reduce the incidence of plugging and blinding in situations of troublesome sand formations or when using lost-circulation material (LCM).</p>
        <p>LCM is prone to work its way between the fine screen layers of most double- and triple-layered screens. In severe instances, it can swell and burst fine-mesh screen cloth. The RHD series shaker screen line was developed as a solution for difficult-to-screen materials such as LCM.</p>
        <p>In addition to solving the issues associated with LCM and other troublesome solids and materials, RHD screens produce less resistance to flow. The proprietary, layered screen technology permits improved fluid conductance while maintaining consistently sharp separations. RHD series screens are available for the COBRA&trade;, LCM, and VSM&trade; series shale shakers, as well as for select competitors&rsquo; models.</p>
