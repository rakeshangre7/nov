        <p>XLW is a unique hybrid connector with an integral pin thread and a weld-on box. The XLW connector features a flush inside diameter (ID) profile and an upset connector outside diameter (OD), which forms an integral lift shoulder.<br />
        <br />
        The XLW connector features wedge thread technology and an internal, metal-to-metal pressure seal and is rated to 100% of pipe body capacity in internal pressure, external pressure, tension, compression, and bending. XLW connectors are ideally suited for critical casing strings where both pressure and structural strength are design drivers.<br />
        <br />
        XLW connectors make-up in approximately three turns, the majority of which are low-torque spin-up until the wedge thread surfaces engage. Wedge thread technology provides anti-rotation in open water without the need for installation of an additional locking device.<br />
        <br />
        XLW connectors are suitable for makeup with either power tongs or manual tongs. Makeup torques are comparatively low and range from 30,000 to 60,000 ft-lb depending on size. XLW connectors are manufactured in 20- to 48-in. diameters.</p>
