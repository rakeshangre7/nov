      Value: "The Grant Prideco™ uLtimate™ Connection Series, comprised of uXT™ and uGPDS™, is specifically designed to provide increased torque capacity. This is achieved by using high-strength materials and making up the connection to a higher torque level. Even at this higher makeup torque level, the fatigue-resistant thread form and cold-rolled thread roots increase fatigue life above that of standard GPDS™ and XT™ connections. The high-strength properties of the uLtimate Series increase performance, and the durability of these connections extends service life."
