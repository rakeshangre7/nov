        <p>A robust tool for gathering and understanding dynamic data recorded during well operations, the i-Con&trade; is a compact, memory-based monitoring sub equipped with an electronics package consisting of sensors, batteries, and memory for use in coiled tubing and drill pipe operations. Traditionally, the gathering of precise mechanical downhole dynamic data has been limited to the use of measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools during drilling operations. In most well operations in the completion and intervention phase, the same downhole data would provide valuable input for operational verification, information, and diagnostics. The i-Con has drill pipe connections and a full-bore inside diameter (ID) to ensure seamless integration into most work string setups. The intelligent sub records tension, compression, torque, temperature, pressure, vibrations, and acceleration where it matters&mdash;downhole. Once the i-Con has been retrieved from the hole, the data can be downloaded from the easily available data port. Downhole data can then be investigated and compared with surface measurements to provide improved understanding and learning.</p>
