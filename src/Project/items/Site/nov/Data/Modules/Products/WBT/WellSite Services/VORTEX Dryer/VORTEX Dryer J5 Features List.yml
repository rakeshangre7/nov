        <p>The Vortex Dryer reduces and recovers base fluid from a variety of feed slurries. In drilling operations, shale shakers discard drilled cuttings up to 20% oil by weight. Treatment with the Vortex Dryer has proven to reduce this oil content dramatically, in some cases below 2%.</p>
        <h2>Additional Benefits:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Recover valuable base fluid for reuse</li>
            <li>Reduce solid waste volumes to curb-haulage cost</li>
            <li>Meet environmental objectives or guidelines</li>
            <li>Reduce fluid content on cuttings before other forms of treatment, increasing waste treatment efficiency</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Vortex Dryer often meets several of these objectives simultaneously. In some applications, it offsets operational costs by saving time, reducing drilling-fluid dilution needs, or increasing process treatment capacity. </p>
        <p>The Vortex Dryer uses centrifugal force to recover oil from drilled solids in oil- or synthetic-based fluids. A stainless steel screen bowl traps &ldquo;wet&rdquo; solids and accelerates them to 540 G&rsquo;s with centrifugal force. Liquid is forced through the screen bowl openings, while &ldquo;dry&rdquo; solids are extracted by the angled flights attached to the cone, which rotate slightly slower than the bowl. </p>
        <p>Extensive field use and long-term monitoring prove that the Vortex Dryer meets strict environmental discharge criteria. The Vortex Dryer system helps operators comply with effluent limitations as mandated by the US Environmental Protection Agency for offshore drilling operations and has been used in various applications, including thermal desorption pretreatment and bioremediation pretreatment.</p>
        <p>To reduce maintenance requirements for the Vortex Dryer, normal wear parts are accessible from the top of the machine, belts can be changed without removing the gear assembly, and the entire gear assembly can be removed with minimal effort. Special materials&mdash;like tungsten carbide and ceramic tiles&mdash;are applied to high-wear areas. Each Vortex Dryer system is configured to specific site requirements. Low-profile versions integrate dual augers to remove solids and are ideal for height-restrictive installations. Vortex Dryer systems have set the standard for offshore operation. </p>
