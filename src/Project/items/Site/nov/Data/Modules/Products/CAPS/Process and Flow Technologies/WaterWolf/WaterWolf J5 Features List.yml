        <p>Launched in 2015, the WaterWolf&trade; Dynamic Oil Recovery (DOR) system is now available in two sizes: DOR 175 and DOR 500. Our higher-capacity model (DOR 500) can handle up to 50,000 BWPD. The WaterWolf system recovers oil and suspended solids from produced water in a single stage of treatment without the use of chemicals or filters. Please visit our website to calculate your potential cost savings and learn more about our newest produced water treatment solution.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Recover more oil</h2>
        <p>The WaterWolf recovers more usable hydrocarbons than traditional methods&mdash;as much as 20 additional barrels of oil for every 10,000 barrels of water produced. More oil recovered in the process means less hazardous waste to treat, store, transport, and dispose of later. (Not to mention,and more money in your pocket.)</p>
        <h2>Cut out chemicals</h2>
        <p>Commonly used water treatment chemicals can contaminate recoverable oil, creating an unsellable sludge. Plus, residual chemicals can reduce well injectivity. Our patented dynamic- loop hydrocyclone technology uses physics to separate oil, eliminating or reducing the need for these expensive, detrimental treatment chemicals altogether.</p>
        <h2>Increase revenue</h2>
        <p>Reduced chemical usage, lower well injection pressures, less frequent well workovers, and simplified operations translate into lower operating costs. The total cost reduction using the WaterWolf DOR system versus conventional methods can range from 5- to 15 cents per barrel of water treated.</p>
        <h2>Safer operation</h2>
        <p>The WaterWolf DOR system treats produced water under pressure, minimizing or eliminating tanks which that can be a major source of air emissions. By keeping solids out of water tanks, the WaterWolf also eliminates hazardous and messy confined -space- entry tank cleaning jobs. Cleaner air and safer working conditions are better for the environment, neighboring communities, and plant personnel.</p>
        <h2>Small footprint</h2>
        <p>The skid-mounted system reduces and/or eliminates the need for multiple skim -tank configurations and gas flotation devices. Plus, the WaterWolf is light and compact enough to be shipped by standard container or flatbed truck. Most installations can be completed in one day.</p>
        <h2>Extended well life</h2>
        <p>Reducing the cost to handle a barrel of water will extend the economic life of a well. Dealing efficiently with high- water production keeps more wells producing longer&mdash;with cleaner, safer, and more profitable results.</p>
