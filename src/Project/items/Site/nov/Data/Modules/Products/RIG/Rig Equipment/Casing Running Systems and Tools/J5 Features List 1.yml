        <p>Confidence and safety with NOV casing running tools</p>
        <p>Our aim is to increase crew safety and improve rig operations with hands-free and fully automated casing handling operations. We are bringing innovations to the drill floor with providing integrating casing tongs, handling equipment, torque verification, and zone management.</p>
        <p>The CRT-350 (Casing Running Tool) introduces a change in the way casing is run on land rigs and smaller offshore drilling rigs. By combining the functionality of tools such as the top drive, flush-mounted spider (FMS), fill and circulation tool, and single-joint horizontal elevator (SJH), casing drilling systems are now safer, faster, and more efficient. The casing running tool connects directly to the top drive main shaft to hoist and lower casing, spin in, and make up the casing connection. Additionally, while reciprocating and rotating the casing string, the casing running tool can fill up and circulate up to 5,000 psi. Review the CRT Reference Guide for more information.</p>
        <p>Casing Module CM-22 and Torque Turn</p>
        <p>The casing module consists of an upper tong, backup tong, and a stabbing guide. It is easily and quickly hooked on to the roughneck by hydraulic and electric quick connectors. Zone management and safety systems, including the NOV Torque Turn casing drilling logging system, ensure efficient, safe, and reliable makeup and breakout performances when fully automated and integrated into NOV control systems. The Torque Turn logging system is designed to monitor and log data from casing pipe spin-in and makeup operations and to perform data analysis according to given criteria for an acceptable connection. Torque Turn integrated casing tongs and NOV’s casing-ready pipe rackers enable the rig crew to perform all casing pipe handling and logging under the supervision of professional casing supervisors. Together with a third-party approved torque verification sub, this setup ensures casing tong performance, including documentation and logging of a safe and reliable casing connection. Torque Turn visualizes the torque curves and suggests the torque shoulder point for makeup and spin-in operations. The system’s analysis function assists the operator by identifying and assessing the casing connection execution. The operator is prompted to revise the connection analysis before acceptance or rejection, introducing a systematic method to ensure a consistent approach for maintaining integrity of the entire well. For more information, review the CM-22 and Torque Turn reference guide attached in the related resources tab.</p>
