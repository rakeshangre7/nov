        <p>The Setter composite frac plug is a full composite design frac plug, and the Setter dissolvable frac plug is a fully metallic dissolvable plug. Both provide a dependable method for temporary zonal isolation during frac operations in vertical and horizontal completions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The compact design and all-composite construction allow quicker milling times for the plug as well as less debris to remove from the well. The plug may be installed with the ball in place in applications of low well pressure or where reduced water consumption is a must. The plug also has a pump-down ring option to further reduce water consumption.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The unique dissolvable material and robust design eliminates milling and post-frac cleanout, leaving no debris to remove from the well and increasing efficiency.</p>

        <p>The Setter composite frac plug is a full composite design frac plug, and the Setter dissolvable frac plug is a fully metallic dissolvable plug. Both provide a dependable method for temporary zonal isolation during frac operations in vertical and horizontal completions.</p>
        <p>The compact design and all-composite construction allow quicker milling times for the plug as well as less debris to remove from the well. The plug may be installed with the ball in place in applications of low well pressure or where reduced water consumption is a must. The plug also has a pump-down ring option to further reduce water consumption.</p>
        <p>The unique dissolvable material and robust design eliminates milling and post-frac cleanout, leaving no debris to remove from the well and increasing efficiency.</p>
