        <p><strong>Head-to-head comparison</strong><br />
        Lab tests have proven that the concave surfaces of the KMX-V element promote more cross-stream flow than competitive designs with flat blades. This feature enhances the performance of the mixer in tough, high-viscosity ratio applications. Sheets of low-viscosity additives are driven along the trough of each blade and abruptly sheared by strong cross-stream velocity gradients as they pass around the upstream surface.<br />
        <br />
        Mixture uniformity was determined by sampling the flow at the discharge end of the mixers using a specially constructed honeycomb sampler that gathered all material passing through the pipe. Data were collected at 20 points about the cross-section of the mixers for greater accuracy.</p>
        <p>The KMX-V rated number one in providing better mixing per unit length than any other mixer on the market. Its pressure drop per unit length was identical to the competition, making the mixing efficiency of the KMX-V higher than the other test units.</p>
        <p>Principles of Operation</p>
        <p>The KMX-V uses cross-stream mixing and flow splitting to achieve rapid blending. Each element is approximately one pipe diameter in length and consists of multiple intersecting blades, which generate fluid layers as the mixture flows downstream. Each blade features concave construction, offering better cross-stream flow than flat blades for superior mixing per unit length in tough, high-viscosity ratio applications. Sheets of low-viscosity additives are driven along the trough of each blade and abruptly sheared by strong cross-stream velocity gradients as they pass around the upstream surface.</p>
        <p>Laminar Blending<br />
        As the additive enters the mixer, it is driven along the trough of each blade. At each blade intersection, the additive is sheared by strong cross-stream velocity gradients as it passes around the upstream surface. This mixing mechanism occurs thousands of times within a short mixing length. The result is that the additive is sheared into continuously finer striations and distributed evenly through the pipe and into viscous main fluid.</p>
        <p>Dispersions<br />
        The same mixing process as described above can also be used to disperse liquids into high-viscosity fluids. However, rather than diffusing into the main stream, the additive forms droplets of decreasing diameter as they progress further down the pipeline.</p>
