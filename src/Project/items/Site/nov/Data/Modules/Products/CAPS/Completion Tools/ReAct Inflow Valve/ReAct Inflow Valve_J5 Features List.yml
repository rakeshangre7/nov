        <p>The ReAct&trade; Inflow Valve (RIV) is a permanently installed and electronically actuated sleeve-type valve that facilitates the control of well flow through ports or installed chokes. The on-board electronics require no connection to surface, as the valve uses our ReAct remote signaling technology.</p>
        <p>Multiple valves can be installed in a wellbore with isolation packers above and below to provide zonal control and isolation. Their flexible functionality and modular design enable a range of applications such as remote water shutoff, selective startup, sand-screen optimization, and zonal fracturing.</p>
        <p>A typical valve features two independent ReAct electronics modules&mdash;either of which can provide the actuation for the device. The electronics are easily programmed at the wellsite from a laptop computer running standard Windows software.</p>
        <p>The valves can be run in either the open or closed position depending on the application, and current functionality allows the valve to be cycled twice. This means that, once in the well, a valve run in the closed position can be remotely signaled open and then remotely signaled back to the closed position. Contingency exists to open or close the valves at any time using conventional wireline techniques to mechanically shift the valves to the open or closed position, or by coiled tubing using our proprietary hydraulic shifting tool.</p>

        <p>The ReAct&trade; Inflow Valve (RIV) is a permanently installed and electronically actuated sleeve-type valve that facilitates the control of well flow through ports or installed chokes. The on-board electronics require no connection to surface, as the valve uses our ReAct remote signaling technology.</p>
        <p>Multiple valves can be installed in a wellbore with isolation packers above and below to provide zonal control and isolation. Their flexible functionality and modular design enable a range of applications such as remote water shutoff, selective startup, sand-screen optimization, and zonal fracturing.</p>
        <p>A typical valve features two independent ReAct electronics modules&mdash;either of which can provide the actuation for the device. The electronics are easily programmed at the wellsite from a laptop computer running standard Windows software.</p>
        <p>The valves can be run in either the open or closed position depending on the application, and current functionality allows the valve to be cycled twice. This means that, once in the well, a valve run in the closed position can be remotely signaled open and then remotely signaled back to the closed position. Contingency exists to open or close the valves at any time using conventional wireline techniques to mechanically shift the valves to the open or closed position, or by coiled tubing using our proprietary hydraulic shifting tool.</p>
