        <p>TracPlates&trade; are tag plates with embedded RFID transponders that can also be fitted to existing plates. The term &ldquo;intelligent tagging&rdquo; refers to electronic identification technology applied to assets and/or resources in addition to the more common physical identification tags. With a unique tag ID, TracPlates convey reliable information regarding asset documentation, location, and service history that can be attributed to individual pieces of equipment to improve process quality and safety.</p>
        <p>The RFID transponders can be read electronically by handheld or fixed readers.</p>
        <p>TracPlates from TracID offers the power of electronically readable RFID transponders directly integrated into conventional tag plates or as retrofit solutions for existing metal tag plates. TracID captures the correct mapping between the electronic ID and physical tag ID. The ID mappings are stored in a database that is delivered to the customer as part of the service provided by TracPlates.</p>
        <p>TracPlates offer the potential to connect reliable information directly to each individual component and use this information within operations to improve processes and safety.</p>
