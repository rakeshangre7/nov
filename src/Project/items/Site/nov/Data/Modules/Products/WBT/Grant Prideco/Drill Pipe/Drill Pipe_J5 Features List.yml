        <p>With our worldwide operations, expert engineering and design resources, and global service network, we are the source for all your drill stem needs.</p>
        <p>At Grant Prideco, it’s our mission to increase efficiency, improve performance, and reduce your total cost of ownership. From the design room to the well site, we produce the industry’s highest-quality, innovative drill pipe technologies that will help you achieve lasting success.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Connection technologies</h2>
        <p>As the leader in the development of rotary-shouldered connections, our products are engineered to optimize drill pipe performance. With four generations of double-shouldered connections, we have developed technologies to meet the demands of any drilling challenge.</p>
        <h2>Grade technologies</h2>
        <p>Grant Prideco’s purposefully engineered drill pipe material grades provide increased product performance and integrity. Our high-strength grades help you drill safer and deeper with reduced hook loads and improved hydraulics. Our sour service grades deliver outstanding performance while resisting sulfide stress cracking (SSC), helping you drill safely and efficiently in harsh, sour conditions.</p>
        <h2>Custom-engineered products</h2>
        <p>In addition to a complete line of drill stem products and accessories, we design, engineer, qualify, and produce fit-for-purpose solutions for specialized or unusually demanding drilling, completion, and intervention operations. With our portfolio of projects developed in partnership with operators, we are the premier provider of customized drilling solutions.</p>
