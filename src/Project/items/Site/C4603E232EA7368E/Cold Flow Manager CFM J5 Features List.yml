        <p>Our new, patent-pending cold-flow manager (CFM) not only accelerates wellhead safety equipment operation but also requires minimal components and has a plug-and-play capability with existing equipment.</p>
        <p>A common safety challenge in cold-temperature working conditions is maintaining hydraulic flow during operations. Our design is more affordable and dependable than other methods, and its unique simplicity makes it particularly practical. It supplies hydraulic flow from all the control hoses on the well control power system and delivers it all to the one set of blowout preventer (BOP) rams selected. The high fluid viscosity due to low outside temperatures is overcome by the CFM&rsquo;s focused flow.</p>
        <p>We understand your need for quick BOP ram actuation. Adding only the CFM to the well control system, we have been able to increase flow 3 to 4 times compared to a standard BOP supply system. Further, adding relatively small accumulators to the supply and return sides of the CFM allows a selectable flow increase of up to 9 times, enabling BOP operation in cold temperatures with a timely response.</p>
