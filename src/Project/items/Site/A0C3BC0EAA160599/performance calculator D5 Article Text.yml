        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Drill pipe assembly properties are calculated based on uniform outside diameter (OD) and wall thickness. No safety factor is applied. The information provided for various inspection classes and for various wear conditions (remaining body wall) is for information only and does not represent or imply acceptable operating limits. It is the responsibility of the User and the end user of the ultimate product to determine the appropriate performance ratings and acceptable use of the product, maintain safe operational practices, and apply a prudent safety factor suitable for the application. For API connections that have different pin and box ODs, tool joint inside diameter (ID) refers to the pin ID. Per Chapter B, Section 4 VII of the IADC drilling manual, it is recommended that drilling torque should not exceed 80% of makeup torque (MUT). &nbsp;</p>
