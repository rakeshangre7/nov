        <p>The WRSV-5/10E is a wireline retrievable safety valve (WRSV) rated for working pressures of either 5,000 psi (34,474 psi) or 10,000 psi (68,948 kPa) and temperatures up to 300°F (149°C). The WRSV compact design uses a metal-to-metal flapper closure seal and an optional self-equalizing flapper to provide 100% well containment when closed.</p>
        <p>The WRSV is primary used when a tubing retrievable safety valve (TRSV) cannot be used because of dimensional constraints in the well completion. It also functions as a backup, redundant safety valve to nonfunctioning TRSVs. Downhole-specific material selection options are available for both corrosive and erosive environments.</p>
        <p>The WRSV-5/10E is connected to a downhole lock and landed in either a dedicated hydraulic landing nipple or inside a TRSV where hydraulic communication has been established. The WRSV operates with a surface-controlled emergency shutdown (ESD) system that supplies hydraulic control pressure to actuate the WRSV’s flow tube to open and close the flapper. The WRSV is a fail-safe, normally closed valve that will protect production installations from uncontrolled flow if wellhead equipment is damaged in a catastrophic event. After shut-ins, the optional self-equalizing flapper design facilitates a rapid return to production, reducing operational downtime. The WRSV is tested/certified to API-14A-V1 and manufactured in accordance with ISO-9001:2015 standards. Materials selection options are based on NACE MR-0175 compliance. We provide global service support for installation, field repair, and maintenance from over 28 service centers worldwide.</p>

        <p>The WRSV-5/10E is a wireline retrievable safety valve (WRSV) rated for working pressures of either 5,000 psi (34 474 psi) or 10,000 psi (68 948 kPa) and temperatures up to 300 &deg;F (149 &deg;C). The WRSV compact design uses a metal-to-metal flapper closure seal and an optional self-equalizing flapper to provide 100% well containment when closed.</p>
        <p>The WRSV is primarily used when a tubing retrievable safety valve (TRSV) cannot be used because of dimensional constraints in the well completion. It also functions as a backup, redundant safety valve to nonfunctioning TRSVs. Downhole-specific material selection options are available for both corrosive and erosive environments.</p>
        <p>The WRSV-5/10E is connected to a downhole lock and landed in either a dedicated hydraulic landing nipple or inside a TRSV where hydraulic communication has been established. The WRSV operates with a surface-controlled emergency shutdown (ESD) system that supplies hydraulic control pressure to actuate the WRSV&rsquo;s flow tube to open and close the flapper. The WRSV is a fail-safe, normally closed valve that will protect production installations from uncontrolled flow if wellhead equipment is damaged in a catastrophic event. After shut-ins, the optional self-equalizing flapper design facilitates a rapid return to production, reducing operational downtime. </p>
        <p>The WRSV is tested/certified to API-14A-V1 and manufactured in accordance with ISO-9001:2015 standards. Materials selection options are based on NACE MR-0175 compliance. We provide global service support for installation, field repair, and maintenance from over 28 service centers worldwide.</p>
