        <p>The BRANDT&trade; Transfer System (BTS) by WellSite Services&rsquo; FluidControl group transfers slurries of drilled solids, wastes, and sludge from one point to another or to an off-site location. Specifically, the BTS is used to pump drilled material from closed-loop systems, reserve pits, barges, oil storage tanks, and bulk haulage vessels. Suitable for offshore or land applications, the BTS is especially effective in capturing discarded drilling wastes in closed-loop systems. As such, the system eliminates the need for backhoes, sloops, and/or other such equipment. Additionally, a boom can be mounted to the unit to provide quick transfer of slurries directly to waiting trucks or vessels.</p>
        <p>The BTS consists of a patented submersible pump and transfer system. The pump is mounted on a self-contained tank with an integrated power pack and is available as a stand-alone, semi-portable unit. The submersible pump features a unique intake-assist head and hydraulic drive motor that work to easily transfer concentrated slurries. The motor is variable speed, thus providing operational flexibility in situations of varying material consistency.</p>
        <p>The BTS is equipped with its own hydraulic power supply and has a choice in motor drive system of diesel or electric. Environmentally safe hydraulic fluids and high-pressure hoses ensure compliance with Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) requirements. The system integrates well with other waste management technologies such as centrifugal dryers, cuttings injection systems, closed-loop systems, pit closures, biotreatment, and others.</p>
