        <p>Centricast&trade; RB-2530 pipe is manufactured with glass fabrics and a highly resilient formulation of aromatic amine-cured epoxy resin. The excellent chemical resistance of the Centricast RB-2530 piping system provides longer service life than traditional piping materials. Pipe performance conveying chemical mixtures and hot caustics is particularly exceptional, resulting in a reduction in maintenance and replacement costs. Centricast RB-2530 proprietary resin formulation provides the toughness for many corrosive slurries and comes in 20-ft nominal or exact lengths.</p>
        <p>The unique construction of centrifugally cast RB pipe offers an easy-to-install epoxy piping system with the best support spacing in the industry. With a 100% resin corrosion barrier, Centricast piping systems provide the most chemically resistant pipe in the market. These pipes have 60 years of successful history in the steel pickling, chloro-alkali, pharmaceutical, power generation, and chemical processing industries.</p>
