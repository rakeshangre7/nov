        <p>We are excited to announce the launch of our new <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DFCB1C62D81B45189B1905D924E8389F&amp;_z=z">Hygienic pump</a>&nbsp;that provides the gentlest pumping action on the market for solids handling. The pump uses the advantages of the progressing cavity pump principle, which promotes low shear, solids handling, and minimal emulsification of the products being pumped.
        </p>
        <p>The Hygienic pump transfers solids up to 1 in. in diameter and incurs minimal product degradation in shear-sensitive applications like salad dressings and salsas. It is also capable of moving suspended solids with minimal damage to products such as diced fruits, vegetables, and soups. Additionally, the robust nature of the pump allows it to efficiently move viscous products (even over 1,000,000 cps) like peanut butter, candies, and jam. The Hygienic pump cost-effectively handles thin liquids such as soups and juices and corrosive applications like citric acid and vinegar while providing a long service life in abrasive applications like soybean slurries.
        </p>
        <p>NOV designed the Hygienic pump to suit varying conditions and challenges for sites and factories, giving users installation flexibility for clean-in-place (CIP) and clean-out-of-place situations. The pump can be used for CIP procedures, allowing the system to be cleaned via a dedicated CIP or steam-in-place system. The pump design allows quick disassembly for easy cleaning when out-of-place cleaning is required.
