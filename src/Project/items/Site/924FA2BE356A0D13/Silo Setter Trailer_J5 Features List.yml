        <p>Towed by a fifth-wheel hitch, the Wilco™ silo setter trailer can be can be conveniently transported between field sites without the use of a separate trailer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">This trailer is used to help meet the need to reduce the footprint of equipment on job sites. A single silo setter trailer can be used to transport and deploy multiple lay-down/stand-up (LDSU) silos, reducing the cost and square footage required to maintain a fleet of field bin storage trailers. It can be used in conjunction with several different sizes and models of our LDSU silo product line and other LDSU silo makes.</span></p>

        <ul>
            <li style="color: #000000;">Wet kit: The Wilco silo setter trailer can optionally be used with a hydraulic wet kit&ndash;equipped tractor to power the hydraulic systems on the trailer, or it can be equipped with its own diesel-driven hydraulic power unit (HPU), negating the need for a dedicated tractor. Tractor wet kits should be capable of producing 23 gpm (87 Lpm) at 2,000 psi (13.8 MPa) for similar operating characteristics to those of the Wilco silo setter trailer with optional HPU.&nbsp;</li>
            <li style="color: #000000;">Use as flatbed: Both the stationary and tilt beds are covered with steel tread flooring to allow the trailer to be used as a flatbed transport when not used for transporting and deploying silos. Stake pockets are also provided on both sides of the bed to ease in the securing of cargo.&nbsp;</li>
            <li style="color: #000000;">Hydraulics: The hydraulic systems that make up the trailer are the tilt cylinders, locking cylinders, and outriggers. The telescoping tilt cylinders are capable of producing forces more than 100,000 lb (444.8 kN) and are used to deploy and load silos for transport. The locking cylinders have two stages. Twin cylinders, located in the upper portion of the tilt bed, run in tandem to lift the silo in preparation to being laid down on the bed by the tilt cylinders. After the silo is laid down in the transport position, these twin cylinders can be used to slide the silo forward on the trailer bed. Once the silo is in the transport position, the second-stage locking cylinder, located in the lower portion of the tilt bed, is used to lock the silo in place and add secondary safety in securing the silo should any tie-downs malfunction. The third system making up&nbsp;the Wilco silo setter trailer is the stabilizer system. The stabilizing outriggers are installed at the rear of the trailer behind the axles. The outriggers provide a wider base at the ground at the tilt bed pivot point. This prevents unwanted motion in the trailer while deploying or loading the silo.&nbsp;</li>
            <li style="color: #000000;">Controls: Conveniently and safely located at a work station at the front of the stationary bed on the road side of the trailer.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wet kit:</strong> The Wilco silo setter trailer can optionally be used with a hydraulic wet kit&ndash;equipped tractor to power the hydraulic systems on the trailer, or it can be equipped with its own diesel-driven hydraulic power unit (HPU), negating the need for a dedicated tractor. Tractor wet kits should be capable of producing 23 gpm (87 Lpm) at 2,000 psi (13.8 MPa) for similar operating characteristics to those of the Wilco silo setter trailer with optional HPU.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use as flatbed:</strong> Both the stationary and tilt beds are covered with steel tread flooring to allow the trailer to be used as a flatbed transport when not used for transporting and deploying silos. Stake pockets are also provided on both sides of the bed to ease in the securing of cargo.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hydraulics:</strong> The hydraulic systems that make up the trailer are the tilt cylinders, locking cylinders, and outriggers. The telescoping tilt cylinders are capable of producing forces more than 100,000 lb (444.8 kN) and are used to deploy and load silos for transport. The locking cylinders have two stages. Twin cylinders, located in the upper portion of the tilt bed, run in tandem to lift the silo in preparation to being laid down on the bed by the tilt cylinders. After the silo is laid down in the transport position, these twin cylinders can be used to slide the silo forward on the trailer bed. Once the silo is in the transport position, the second-stage locking cylinder, located in the lower portion of the tilt bed, is used to lock the silo in place and add secondary safety in securing the silo should any tie-downs malfunction. The third system making up the Wilco silo setter trailer is the stabilizer system. The stabilizing outriggers are installed at the rear of the trailer behind the axles. The outriggers provide a wider base at the ground at the tilt bed pivot point. This prevents unwanted motion in the trailer while deploying or loading the silo.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Controls:</strong> Controls are conveniently and safely located at a work station at the front of the stationary bed on the road side of the trailer.</li>

        <p>Towed by a fifth-wheel hitch, the Wilco&trade; silo setter trailer can be conveniently transported between field sites without the use of a separate trailer.</p>
        <p>This trailer is used to help meet the need to reduce the footprint of equipment on job sites. A single silo setter trailer can be used to transport and deploy multiple lay-down/stand-up (LDSU) silos, reducing the cost and square footage required to maintain a fleet of field bin storage trailers. It can be used in conjunction with several different sizes and models of our LDSU silo product line and other LDSU silo makes.</p>
