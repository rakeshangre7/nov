      Hint: description
      Value: <p>The expanding plug valve has a robust, clear acrylic indicator flag protector, keeping moisture and debris from infiltrating the operator housing. The top of the indicator cap is vented to ensure that air flow will quickly evaporate any condensation that appears inside the clear housing. Our expanding plug valve has a relief system port located on the upper section of the valve body, eliminating any need to disassemble the relief system to remove the valve bonnet, while the lower trunnion of the valve is an integral part of the lower bonnet and is not part of the plug. This design feature means that there is no cavity present in the bottom of the valve body to collect dirt, scale, ice, or other debris that could make the valve hard to turn or otherwise interfere with valve function, leading to less maintenance downtime.</p>
