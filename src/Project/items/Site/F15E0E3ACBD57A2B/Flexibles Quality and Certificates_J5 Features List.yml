        <p>A constant attention to Health, Safety, Environment (HSE) and Quality (Q) is key to every offshore operation. This means complying with not only the Danish Occupational Health and Safety Act and Working Environment Act and corresponding local legislation but also typical offshore requirements with a quality system certified according to ISO 9001, API Q1, TS29001, OHSAS 18001, and ISO 14001.</p>
        <p>Our operational top priorities are minimizing risks to personnel and the environment as well as protecting our stakeholders&rsquo; assets. To support this, we employ a unique competence and documentation system in which staff training, site inspections, toolbox meetings, and safety talks help maximize safety as well as enable continuous improvement of safety, quality, and environmental considerations. Furthermore, we operate an internal Improvement Query (IQ) program that not only offers the ability to identify, process, and consolidate individually identified areas for improvement but also handles incidental deviation from established best practice.</p>
        <p>As a unique initiative, we embed LEAN principles and resources within both HSE and Quality to facilitate the continuous improvement of processes and work methods. Working with Kaizen-based incremental improvements, improvement queries, and suggestions for the internal Innovation Board, we have fostered a culture in which quality, improvements, and innovation interact to create and deliver tangible results for us as well as for our clients.</p>
