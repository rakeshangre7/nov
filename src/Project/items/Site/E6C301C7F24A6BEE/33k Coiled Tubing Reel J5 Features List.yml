        <p>Our 33K tubing reel is a large capacity tubing reel designed to be skid or trailer mounted and is an upgrade to current reels. Ideally suited for all grades of 2⅜-in. tubing and many grades of 2⅞-in. tubing. Filling a gap in previous reel offerings, the maximum rated payload capacity has been increased to a massive 150,000 lb.</p>
        <p>The high-strength double tapered spoke design is 50% stronger than conventional tubing reels, and flange flex has been decreased by half. The levelwind arm is 33% stiffer than current design. As a result the next generation 33k tubing reel is a stronger and more capable reel for lasting performance. Powering the reel is a hydraulic piston motor paired with a purpose built direct drive gear box. With a maximum drive torque of 33,000 ft-lbs and a maximum speed of 10 rpm, operators can be confident in getting the job done.</p>
        <p>Wireline options that previously required a chain drive can be realized with the performance and reliability of a direct drive. The patent pending hybrid planetary offsets the motor and allows for a collector port for wireline on the drive side. The port can optionally allow for remote hydraulic operation of the spool safety valve. Keeping operator efficiency in mind, we have incorporated the levelwind quick-change ratio cartridges that have been standard on the DID (drop in drum) tubing reels as an option. The quick-change ratio cartridges allow easy levelwind ratio timing when swapping from one pipe size to the next.</p>
