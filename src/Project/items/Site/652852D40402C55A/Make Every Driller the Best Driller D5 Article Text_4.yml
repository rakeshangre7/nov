        <p>"We had one specifically challenging well here that called for incredibly tight control to help protect the formations, and NOVOS delivered that to a degree that I&rsquo;ve never seen before in my career,&rdquo; McCrae noted. &ldquo;I am a big believer in standardization&hellip; This is the next big step-change technology, in my humble opinion."</p>
