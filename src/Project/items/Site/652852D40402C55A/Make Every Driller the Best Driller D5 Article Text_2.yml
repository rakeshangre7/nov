      Hint: body
      Value: <p>NOVOS comes with applications that allow the rig to drill consistently, safely, and more effectively, and it also has the capability to incorporate customized applications for specific drilling requirements. A unique software development kit allows developers to create and deploy their own applications that use sensor data to control rig machines. Third parties are provided with safe access to a wide variety of functions within the system and are encouraged to develop applications that address their unique challenges. Those applications can then be layered, prioritized, and partitioned to provide simple flexibility of control and monitoring in ways previously unachievable.</p>
