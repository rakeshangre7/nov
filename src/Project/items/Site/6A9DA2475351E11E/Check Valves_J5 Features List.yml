      Value: |
        <p>Our high-quality Anson™ check valves are preferred by many service companies due to their dependability in today's harsh environments. Check valves allow flow in only one direction; when the flow stops or reverses direction, the valve shuts, thereby isolating downstream pressure from the upstream source. Our check valves are available in three styles with several types of end connections.</p>
        
        <h2>In-line check valve</h2> 
        <p>Anson in-line check valves are available in two designs: a swing (flapper) check valve or a dart-type check valve. These valves offer a compact design and are suitable for pressures up to 20,000 psi.</p>
        
        <h3>Swing type</h3>
        <p>The swing-type check valve uses a flapper-style closing mechanism. A hinged flapper assembly is seated in the valve, and when fluid flows through the inlet it moves the flapper into the open position and passes through to the outlet. When flow stops, the flapper closes against the seat and prevents backflow towards the inlet. Our in-line swing check valves are available in 2-, 3-, and 4-in. nominal diameter.</p>
        
        <h3>Dart type</h3>
        <p>The dart type valve contains a plunger and spring seating mechanism. Fluid flows through the inlet and unseats the plunger, compressing the spring and allowing fluid to pass through. When flow stops, the spring will force the plunger back into the seat, preventing any backflow towards the inlet.</p>
        
        <h2>Top-entry check valve</h2>
        <p>The Anson top-entry check valve is specifically designed for use with portable, temporary flowlines. The valve is manufactured from a low-alloy steel body and is a robust, cost-effective nonreturn valve. The top-entry check valve allows for service in-situ without removing the valve from the flowline. Simply isolate the valve, remove the bonnet, and replace internal components where needed.</p>
        
        <p>A rubber-coated flapper assembly is situated in the valve. When fluid flows through the inlet it moves the flapper into the open position and passes through to the outlet. When flow stops, the flapper closes against the seat face and prevents backflow towards the inlet.</p>
