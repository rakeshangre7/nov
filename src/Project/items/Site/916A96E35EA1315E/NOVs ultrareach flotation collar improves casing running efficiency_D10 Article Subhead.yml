      Value: "<p>In the modern oil field, extended-reach drilling has become more and more commonplace due to continued advances in technology. Though longer laterals provide an economic advantage with an increased reservoir contact, challenges have remained with setting casing strings at target depth. Wells where the horizontal section is longer than the vertical section have higher frictional forces due to larger contact surfaces. Rotating the casing has traditionally helped with reducing frictional forces in the wellbore, but this increases the requirement in both casing quality and connection strength.</p>"
