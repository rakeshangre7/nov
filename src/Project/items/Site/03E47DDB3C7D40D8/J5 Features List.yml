        We can provide units with all levels of certification to operate in any offshore condition. We offer units that are certified to DNV 2.7.1 Lifting Rules, BP 200 fully certified exhaust gas coolers, complete ATEX certification, and NORSOK certification when required.<br />
        <br />
        Control cabins range from small-footprint steel-shell designs with a simple hose basket for storing all unit hose bundles through multistation, air-purged insulated cabins with multiport hose reels mounted to the front of the cabin skid for interconnection to the reel, injector, powerpack, and BOPs. Three-piece unit designs combine the cabin and power pack on a single skid for fewer lifts from the work boat and a reduced footprint on deck. Reel size is limited only by the capacity of available platform cranes.<br />
        <br />
        Our full line of injectors can be certified for offshore use, with lifting frames designed to handle full-string weight for use in heave compensation lift frames. Power packs are diesel engine driven and provide full unit hydraulic and electric power requirements. Models are also available with electric drive for running on rig power. Power packs for North Sea operation are available with fully compliant soundproof enclosures.
