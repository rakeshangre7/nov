        <p>We provide a unique, versatile once-through testing service, enabling you to develop, optimize and quantify produced water and separation technologies under   field conditions.</p>
        <p>Our test facility at Flotta in the United Kingdom was opened in 1988 to support the development and testing of full-scale offshore process equipment. Since opening, we have established an internationally recognized facility specializing in effluent treatment and water handling, with three-phase separation and electrostatics capabilities having been added in 2016.</p>
        <p>We have the capabilities to operate on a continuous once-through basis, ensuring the feed conditions are constant and unaffected by recirculated test fluids. Our state-of-the-art facilities are manned by experienced, on-site process engineers and chemists who evaluate the technology at every step in the process.</p>
        
        <h3>Technology optimization</h3>
        <p>We provide highly adaptable processes that can be tailored to the requirements of each individual project and client needs. We can vary all conditions throughout testing to ensure the technology is fully evaluated, even when the project changes during the test program.</p>
        
        <h3>Oilfield chemistry services</h3>
        <p>Our experienced chemists offer a variety of oilfield chemistry services and consultancy. We cover a wide range of services from oil-in-water concentration to detailed enhanced oil recovery (EOR) polymer analysis and can provide analysis to support pilot scale testing or conduct detailed laboratory scale studies.</p>
        
        <h3>Technology validation</h3>
        <p>We provide a comprehensive resource for you to evaluate and validate a process technology. Our test facilities enable us to demonstrate the effectiveness of the equipment under controlled conditions. Confirmation of your investment decisions and the ability to assess technologies prior to purchase is extremely valuable. Our technology validation services provide an objective means for testing individual pieces of equipment and complete processes. Technology developers use our independent and confidential service for performance testing of products before introducing them to the market. Our test facilities have also been used for product certification and aiding market promotion via independent trials.</p>
