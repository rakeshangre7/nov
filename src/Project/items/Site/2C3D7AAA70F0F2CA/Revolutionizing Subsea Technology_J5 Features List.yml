        <h2>Robust, Reliable, Retrievable, Retrofittable</h2>
        
        <p>We go above and beyond API requirements for subsea technology—with more cycles and more stress in our tests to prove our robust equipment exceeds your standards. Our equipment is designed to be reliable for your drilling programs and needs, because we know that having reliable equipment is the path to success. At NOV, we're raising the bar on technology standards, enabling retrievable solutions for your retrieve subsea control equipment and increasing your uptime significantly. We're creating technology for tomorrow that can work with equipment you have today—delivering the ease of maintenance and service with equipment that is retrofittable.</p>
