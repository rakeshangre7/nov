        <h2>The MPowerD&trade; choke manifold 5000D provides primary finite control for balanced and underbalanced fluid return rates and wellhead pressure during MPD operations.</h2>
        <p>Our choke manifold offers the widest range of operations in the different MPD variants. As a single-source OEM, NOV offers greater value and a positive impact on your MPD applications and overall ownership costs.</p>
        <h3>Features and Benefits</h3>
        <p><strong>HXE-G3 Choke</strong></p>
        <p>Continuous duty-cycle Siemens electric servo motor </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Yields precise pressure control and quick response times</li>
            <li>Enables choke to function reliably in cold conditions without the cost of running and maintaining hydraulic lines</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remote MPowerD control system operation enables automatic or manual control of the choke</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automatic mode &ndash; The choke rapidly adjusts trim positioning to maintain the setpoint pressure that is input at the control system.</li>
            <li>Manual mode &ndash; The choke can be operated by bypassing the electric motor for inspection and service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Integrated Bypass Line</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enables cement and the casing shoe to be drilled out without impacting the chokes while in MPD mode</li>
            <li>Bypasses the MPD system without impacting drilling operations when the system is not in use</li>
            <li>Directs pressure and fluids safely away from personnel servicing the choke while online</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>ANSON E-Type Gate Valves</strong></p>
        <p>Two types of valve actuators used</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rotork&trade; Electric Actuator &ndash; remote actuation </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Isolates either or both legs of the manifold</li>
                <li>Designed with spring-return fail-safe double-acting (DA) cylinders to fail in place</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Manual Actuator &ndash; local operation at the manifold</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Through-conduit gate valves are robust and easy to maintain</p>
        <p>Forged steel body and bonnet, bi-directional sealing, low operating torque, and manually operated (non-rising stem)</p>
        <p><strong>MPD 30 PRV</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuous monitoring of the wellbore pressure to prevent overpressurization scenarios</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Hard trip &ndash; set at the highest expected pressure</li>
                <li>Soft trip &ndash; set dynamically by the MPD operator </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Fail-in-place design prevents unintentional pressure fluctuations</li>
            <li>Bleeds off only excess pressure and will close under pressure to maintain setpoint</li>
            <li>Network-capable system is interfaced with the MPowerD control system for remote set point control</li>

        <p>The MPowerD&trade; choke manifold 5000D provides primary finite control for balanced and underbalanced fluid return rates and wellhead pressure during MPD operations.</p>
        <p>Our choke manifold offers the widest range of operations in the different MPD variants. As a single-source OEM, NOV offers greater value and a positive impact on your MPD applications and overall ownership costs.</p>
        <p><strong>HXE-G3 choke</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuous duty-cycle Siemens electric servo motor
            <ul>
                <li>Yields precise pressure control and quick response times</li>
                <li>Enables choke to function reliably in cold conditions without the cost of running and maintaining hydraulic lines</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remote MPowerD control system operation enables automatic or manual control of the choke</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Automatic mode &ndash; The choke rapidly adjusts trim positioning to maintain the setpoint pressure that is input at the control system.</li>
                <li>Manual mode &ndash; The choke can be operated by bypassing the electric motor for inspection and service.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Integrated bypass line</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enables cement and the casing shoe to be drilled out without impacting the chokes while in MPD mode</li>
            <li>Bypasses the MPD system without impacting drilling operations when the system is not in use</li>
            <li>Directs pressure and fluids safely away from personnel servicing the choke while online</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Anson E-type gate valves</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two types of valve actuators used
            <ul>
                <li>Rotork&trade; Electric Actuator &ndash; remote actuation
                <ul>
                    <li>Isolates either or both legs of the manifold</li>
                    <li>Designed with spring-return fail-safe double-acting (DA) cylinders to fail in place</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Manual Actuator &ndash; local operation at the manifold</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Through-conduit gate valves are robust and easy to maintain</li>
            <li>Forged steel body and bonnet, bi-directional sealing, low operating torque, and manually operated (non-rising stem)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>MPD 30 PRV</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuous monitoring of the wellbore pressure to prevent overpressurization scenarios
            <ul>
                <li>Hard trip &ndash; set at the highest expected pressure</li>
                <li>Soft trip &ndash; set dynamically by the MPD operator </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fail-in-place design prevents unintentional pressure fluctuations</li>
            <li>Bleeds off only excess pressure and will close under pressure to maintain setpoint</li>
            <li>Network-capable system is interfaced with the MPowerD control system for remote set point control</li>
        </ul>
