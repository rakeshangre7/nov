        <p>When performing integrity testing, we may use our in-house laboratory facilities during the assessment of flexible pipes in service. Testing is performed at one of Flexibles’ two ISO-17025 accredited laboratories.</p>

        <p>Examples of laboratory services from System Assessment Services (SAS):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carcass testing</strong> &amp;ndash Client needed to check carcass compatibility with a high CO2 content. SAS suggested a test program comprising PVDF high-CO2 decompression test (blistering test) and carcass autoclave testing with more test specimens.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Polymer coupon testing</strong> &amp;ndash Polymer coupons retrieved from offshore operation were tested and assessed to evaluate the condition of the internal pressure sheath. A Corrected Inherent Viscosity (CIV) test for PA-11 coupons and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) of the PA11 and PVDF coupons were performed.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dropped object analysis/Impact load</strong> &amp;ndash Project included dissection of flexible pipe samples exposed to different impact loads under different conditions to assess maximum impact load for the particular pipe design.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bending radius test/simulation of installation scenario</strong> &amp;ndash A plane bending test was performed in NOV’s test facility to simulate different installation scenarios with exceeded minimum bend radii (MBR).
            </li>
        </ul>
