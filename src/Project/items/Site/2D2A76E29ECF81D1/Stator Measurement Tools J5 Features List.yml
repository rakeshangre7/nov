        <p>The NOV Stator Measurement Tools (SMT) provide an easy and accurate method to measure downhole motor stator sizes. These tools are manufactured to a tight tolerance and offer precise measurement to an accuracy of &plusmn;0.002 in. with a very high rate of repeatability.</p>
        <p>Accurately measuring rotor and stator clearance to adjust interference for elevated hole temperatures greatly increases stator life. Adequate temperature compensation can even result in successful motor performance at temperatures that exceed manufacturer recommendations.</p>
