        <p>The BRANDT&trade; FreeFlow Positive Pressure Transfer System offers a safe, flexible, and innovative solution for the efficient transportation and storage of drill cuttings. The basic system components include an air conveyor, compressor, piping, and control system. The system can blow solids directly to a skip, storage vessel, or processing unit. Another option would be to process the cuttings with a dryer and use the air conveyor to transport the dried cuttings to a storage vessel.</p>
        <h2>Air conveyor</h2>
        <p>The&nbsp;BRANDT air conveyor contains unique features to ensure reliability and consistent performance. The chisel profile base minimizes chances of bridging, while the integral 14-in. (35-cm) screw ensures accurate feed control as cuttings entering the line are metered. The screw generates a series of aerated slugs to improve pressure control and achieve a consistent flow pattern, while cuttings flow readily into the pipe in an aerated state. Such control minimizes pressure fluctuations, ensuring that pressures are safely controlled and low exit velocities are achieved. A single air conveyor can move more than 80 t/hr of dried solids. The air conveyor can also transfer 164 ft (50 m) vertically, as required for interfield transfers.</p>
        <h2>Pipewatch (optional)</h2>
        <p>Pipewatch monitors line pressures and automatically adds air when needed to eliminate line blockage. The system continually monitors pressures at specific intervals along the length of the line. When a pressure increase occurs in the line, a timed amount of air is injected into the line at a specific point to flush any solids clear, which prevents blockages from accumulating. In addition, the system features data acquisition, which enables recording and historical analysis of events.</p>
        <h2>Control system</h2>
        <p>The operator-friendly PLC-based control system offers unprecedented levels of control in both manual and automatic modes. The operator can monitor the system and set parameters via the 10-in. (25-cm) display. The air conveyor discharge cycle can be set by weight or time. The screw speed is maintained by the pressure sensor on the discharge side of the unit.</p>
        <h2>Slider storage vessels</h2>
        <p>The unique design of the slider tank prevents the blockages associated with conventional conical bottom bulk storage tanks. The slider base enables the introduction of a flat-bottom tank, which removes the danger of bridging. Discharge is ensured through the inclusion of the slider ram and use of an integrated controlled 14-in. discharge screw. The slider tank features diverter valves and load cells within the compact frame design for easy installation of multiple tanks. Each tank is filled and emptied in a safe and controlled fashion. The dimensional design of the slider tank allows for easy transportation by road and removes the requirement to modify a dedicated supply vessel for transportation offshore.</p>
