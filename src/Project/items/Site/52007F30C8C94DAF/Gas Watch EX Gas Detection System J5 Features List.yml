        <p>The Gas Watch&trade; EX standalone gas detection system liberates formation gasses trapped in the returning drilling fluid. This autonomous, certified system is an integral component in identifying gasses that represent a danger to rig personnel and is an indicator of hydrocarbon gas concentrations. It measures light and heavy gas concentrations that aid in well characterization as well as dissolved H2S. Through a patented technology and proprietary filters, dual IR sensors identify the total gas measurement (light and heavy gas) that is unaffected by oil-based mud additives typically seen in all other IR systems.
        The Gas Watch EX system can be used as the primary or backup gas detection system, serving both as analytical tool and a safety system. The system offers additional value to the operator by allowing them to delay the onset of mudlogging services or replace them with our remote logging services. Both options enable the customer to minimize mudlogging service costs while decreasing costs associated with housing rigsite personnel. </p>
