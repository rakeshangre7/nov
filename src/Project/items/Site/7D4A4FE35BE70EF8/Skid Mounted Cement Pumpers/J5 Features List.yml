This system can be run either manually or automatically using the NOV continuous automated mixing (CAM&trade;) control system for accurate cement slurry mixtures. A mixing tub provides adequate volume for slurry recirculation and averaging of slurry density based on bulk fluctuations.</p>"

        <h3>Wilco skid-mounted cement pumper</h3>
        <p>The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FD167300875244A5A101C10C9A2D9373&amp;_z=z">Wilco</a>&trade; WCS-250 250-hp skid-mounted cement pumper provides a rugged, versatile, and economical solution for plug and abandonment jobs, squeeze cementing work, conductor casing work, and surface casing jobs. Our 250-hp cement skid mixes and blends cement and can fine-tune previously mixed cement slurry from a batch mixer and displace the blend downhole. Cement is blended with the Gyro-Energy cement mixing head with recirculation and uses agitators in both mix and averaging tanks. The unit is powered by two engines driving a single high-pressure pump along with the centrifugal pumps and agitators. </p>
