        <p>The nitrogen units are self-contained, complete with skid design, and are perfectly suited for the offshore market. Our units can also be trailer mounted using the ISO locks for land-based operations, offering you equipment flexibility and diverse application options suitable for all markets.</p>
        <p>Our skid-mounted nitrogen units are available in a wide range of pressure and output capacities. The standard output maximum pressure is 10,000 psi, but 15,000 psi is also possible. Units can be provided with output flow rates from 27,000 scfm up to 540,000 scfm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>DNV-certified 270K skid-mounted nitrogen unit </strong></p>
        <p>Our DNV-certified 270K skid-mounted nitrogen unit is designed for use on stimulation vessels and has completed the rigorous testing and certification process of DNV Rules of Ships.</p>
        <p>This DNV certification ensures that you can get your equipment on most, if not all, platforms and boats, including, but not limited to, our low-pressure and high-pressure systems, high-pressure nitrogen vaporizer, centrifugal pump, and cold ends.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Offshore corrosion protection package</strong></p>
        <p>The purpose of the corrosion protection package is to provide additional protection against the harsh corrosive environments associated with offshore applications. The design goal for these options is to provide a seven-year life for the skid in offshore environments. This package includes protection for drip pan and brackets and several alternative stainless design options.</p>
