        <p>The BRANDT&trade; VSM&trade; Multi-Sizer separator is the first to introduce Constant-G Control&trade; to provide optimum performance to meet drilling rates and separation efficiency.</p>
        <h2>Constant-G Control</h2>
        <p>Constant-G Control (CGC) is a patented technology developed to maintain an optimal G-force rating on the VSM Multi-Sizer separator during varying liquid/solids loading conditions. CGC technology maximizes screen performance, solids conveyance, and throughput while enhancing screen life. CGC is an industry first and a standard feature on the VSM Multi-Sizer.</p>
        <p>With the addition of an accelerometer on the basket tied to the variable-frequency drive (VFD) operating the drive motors, the VFD can constantly monitor the Multi-Sizer separator&rsquo;s G-force and adjust the motor speed to maintain the G-force at predetermined setpoints depending on fluid and solids loading on the basket. The Multi-Sizer separator runs at a lower G-force and reduces wear on screens and components while operating with little solids loading. When loading becomes more extreme and higher G&rsquo;s are needed to process all the drilling fluid, the Multi-Sizer separator automatically ramps up to a higher G-force.</p>
        <p>The VSM Multi-Sizer separator also offers a flexible flow (Flex-Flow) system able to run in two unique operating modes: &ldquo;in-series&rdquo; and &ldquo;in-parallel.&rdquo; Changing modes is easily accomplished with an adjustable flow diverter.</p>
        <h2>&ldquo;In-Series&rdquo; Operating Mode</h2>
        <p>The primary function of the VSM Multi-Sizer separator, while in the in-series mode, is to collect lost-circulation and/or wellbore stabilization materials. In this mode, each of the three screening decks is equipped with screens of differing API designations. The Scalping Deck is outfitted with screens for coarse solids removal. Primary Deck 1 is outfitted with API-designated screens that enable the collection of the desired recoverable solids, such as lost-circulation or wellbore stabilization materials. The desired material is conveyed off the screens of Primary Deck 1 and into a collection trough. The trough is angled to route the collected material down two recovery trough sections of the machine and into the sump and active mud system. Primary Deck 2 is outfitted with API-designated screens that enable the removal of low-gravity solids and other fines.</p>
        <h2>&ldquo;In-Parallel&rdquo; Operating Mode</h2>
        <p>The primary function of the VSM Multi-Sizer separator, while in the in-parallel mode, is to maximize screening capacity and throughput. The Scalping Deck is outfitted with screens for coarse solids removal, while Primary Deck 1 and Primary Deck 2 are outfitted with screens of the same API designation. An adjustable overflow weir routes any overflow from Primary Deck 1 to Primary Deck 2. This adjustable weir enables control of the fluid endpoint on Primary Deck 1. Once the desired fluid endpoint is reached on Primary Deck 2, flow is maximized. When operating in the in-parallel mode, the built-in recovery trough on the end of Primary Deck 1 is closed, enabling discharge of solids. The design of this trough enables the user to easily switch between collection and disposal modes with no special tools.</p>
        <h2>Composite Materials</h2>
        <p>The VSM Multi-Sizer separator provides an improved power-to-weight ratio using composite materials (patented) throughout the vibration basket, offering an improved G-force rating without the need for increased horsepower requirements. Composite materials also provide exceptional corrosion resistance in high fluid-flow areas.</p>
        <p>The VSM Multi-Sizer separator features balanced elliptical motion to effectively separate solids from liquid. Screen changes are quickly facilitated with the field-proven Pneumoseal&trade; clamping and sealing system. The HVAC hood, a standard feature on the VSM Multi-Sizer separator, routes hazardous fumes away from the unit and into a ventilation system. </p>
