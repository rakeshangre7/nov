        <p>NOV is a very large, very diverse company. Something that we have been increasingly working towards is helping our customers understand the interconnectedness of our businesses, the way we can come together to provide greater value. The proverb "It takes a village to raise a child" comes to mind here, because we recently did just that—we brought together people from across the company in an extremely impactful and well-received customer event for Latin American operator GeoPark to highlight our diverse and intertwined capabilities.</p>
