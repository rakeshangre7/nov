        <p>Our 10,000- and 15,000-psi slick-cable pack-offs are designed to seal against moving slick-jacketed cable under pressure.</p>
        <p>The patent-pending lightweight slick-cable pack-off works by squeezing either of two independent seal assemblies that are wrapped around the wire. The upper element is used as the primary barrier, with the lower element providing backup; lubricant can be injected above each element. The line wiper rubber is fitted at the top of the pack-off to clean the wire and keep the wireline pressure control equipment (WPCE) clean.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the pack-off features an integrated ball check valve and lower line wiper to ensure lubrication oil is retained and well debris kept out. The pack-off is uniquely designed to ensure that the operator is always in control of the pack-off, facilitating fine control of breakaway cable friction during initial in-hole movement without loss of control.</p>
