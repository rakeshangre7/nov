        <p>The lightweight slick-cable pack-off can be rated for up to 15,000 psi working pressure (WP; for static cable) and H₂S service and is designed so that the rubber elements in direct contact with the wire can be easily replaced. It is available with full material traceability and third-party certification.</p>
        <p>A small combination control unit can be used to operate all features. Alternatively, two hand pumps and hoses operate the packing elements while two further pumps and hoses provide lubricant.</p>
        <p><strong>Features</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Temperature class: P-V -20 to 250 &deg;F (-29 to 121 &deg;C)</li>
            <li>Material class: DD, sour service</li>
            <li>Designed for smooth-surface jacketed (slick) cable</li>
            <li>9701048319 rated to 10,000-psi WP (15,000-psi test pressure)</li>
            <li>9701048644 rated to 15,000-psi WP (22,500-psi test pressure)</li>

        <h4>Slick-cable pack-off control module</h4>
        <p>The air-operated control unit neatly delivers all required functions in one easy-to-operate package. The unit features three air pumps&mdash;one for each function; in addition, each circuit has a hand pump in case of air failure. The unit provides pressure for each pack-off piston, and lubrication oil minimizes friction and packing wear.</p>
