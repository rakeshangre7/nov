        <p style="color: #000000;">Using the same locking dog principle as the Hydraconn and injector connector quick latches, our quick disconnect is designed to increase safety when pumping to additional vessels with flexible hoses and reels. The function of the disconnect is to quickly disconnect in the event of an emergency to avoid damaging the hose when the vessel drifts away.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #000000;">We offer quick disconnects that range in size from 2.56 to 4.06 in. and that are available in 5,000-, 10,000-, and 15,000-psi working pressures. H2S service models are available, along with designs using corrosion-resistant alloy components. End connections can be accommodated for flange, hub, or hose-end connections.</p>

        Texas Oil Tools&trade; pressure control accessories include lubricators and risers, tubing cutters, flow crosses, quick disconnects, adapter flanges, quick unions, adapter spools, and flow tees.
        <h2>Flow cross</h2>
        <p>We offer flow crosses from 2.56 to 7.06 in. with 2.06, 3.06, or 4.06 in. side outlets. Flow crosses can be manufactured to any desired length or the shortest standard length possible.</p>
        <h2>Lubricators and risers</h2>
        <p>Our lubricators and risers have integral (non-welded) end connections or flanges and are manufactured in 5,000, 10,000, and 15,000 psi working pressures.</p>
        <p>Union connections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CB-Bowen </li>
            <li>CO-Otis </li>
            <li>CQ-TOT</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Quick disconnect</h2>
        <p>Using the same locking dog principle as the Hydraconn and injector connector quick latches, our quick disconnect is designed to increase safety when pumping to additional vessels with flexible hoses and reels. The function of the disconnect is to quickly disconnect in the event of an emergency to avoid damaging the hose when the vessel drifts away.</p>
        <p>We offer quick disconnects that range in size from 2.56 to 4.06 in. and that are available in 5,000-, 10,000-, and 15,000-psi working pressures. H<sub>2</sub>S service models are available, along with designs using corrosion-resistant alloy components. End connections can be accommodated for flange, hub, or hose-end connections.</p>
        <h2>Tubing cutter</h2>
        <p>In response to the needs of the coiled tubing industry, we have developed a line of coiled tubing cutters for use in a variety of applications.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Three models are currently available for shearing up to 3.5 in. outside diameter (OD) tubing.</li>
            <li>Hydraulically operated cutter comes in a configuration as light as 42 lb for easy handling. </li>
            <li>Generates over 60,000 lb of force </li>
            <li>Requires only one hydraulic hose connection </li>
            <li>Air spring return for blades</li>
        </ul>
