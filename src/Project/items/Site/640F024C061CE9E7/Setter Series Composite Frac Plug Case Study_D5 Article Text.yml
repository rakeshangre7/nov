      Value: "<p>NOV proposed the Setter Composite Frac Plug to meet the requirements of the operator. The compact design and all-composite construction allow for a quick mill time average of four minutes as well as less debris to remove from the wellbore. The castellated lower slips provide even slip distribution during setting and reduce incidences of plugs being not tagged during drillout. </p>"
