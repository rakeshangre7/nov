      Value: "<p>NOV was approached by BW Offshore to build a seawater and produced water treatment module to meet the water-injection requirements of the FPSO over the life of the Catcher Field. The module utilizes nanofiltration membranes for seawater treatment and a proprietary produced-water technology, which consists of deoiling hydrocyclone liners, degassing vessel internals, and a compact flotation unit. The system can inject produced water, seawater, or a combination of both to enable waterflooding, enhancing recovery and maintaining optimal performance. By removing hydrocarbons from produced water and solids and sulphates from seawater, the injection water is treated to good composition, ensuring well injectivity to maintain pressure during the lifespan of the reservoir.</p>"
