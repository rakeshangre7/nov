        <p>NOV also delivered 4338 m (14,232 ft) of fiberglass pipe and an APL&trade; turret and mooring system to complement the water treatment module. In total, employees spent more than 1.2 million man hours on equipment, which was supplied to the vessel with zero lost time incidents for the entire project. This major accomplishment was the result of close cooperation and vigilance from the safety teams of Premier, BW Offshore, and NOV. NOV received compliments from BW Offshore for piping design and layout, as well as work performed on the North Sea compliance documentation that required DNV approval. The final quality of the workmanship of the module was also praised by BW Offshore.</p>
        <p>We&rsquo;re proud to have delivered a custom solution to BW Offshore that will help them unlock the full value of this challenging development in the coming years.</p>
