        <p>M/D Totco's AutoTally™ uses RFID technology, cutting-edge information technology, and advanced software to create a 100% accurate drill string tally in real time. This revolutionary technology captures and stores usage data, such as position in tally, rotating hours, number of rotations, and hours in well, for each tagged string component during every tally operation. The system can be integrated into many types of drilling rigs, making it a feasible option for nearly every customer.</p>
        <p>AutoTally is part of the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C1BBF8EE34934FD4AF7946895C3525E5&amp;_z=z">TracID™ Life-Cycle Management</a>&nbsp;program.</p>
        <h2>TracTag – Proven RFID tag durability</h2>
        <p>Used for more than 10 years in downhole applications, TracTag™ masters the most demanding conditions and is recognized and accepted by central players in the drilling industry. The RFID transponder can be embedded in any drill string component. The tag is read when it passes through the rotary table antenna. The tubular is designed to withstand most well conditions, including g-forces, well temperatures, vibrations, and pressures.</p>
        <h3>Antenna</h3>
        <p>The antenna is placed under the rotary table without interfering with ongoing drilling operations and is designed to work in typical drilling environments where mud and other fluids are present.</p>
        <h3>AutoTally server</h3>
        <p>The RFID readings are transmitted from the antenna to the AutoTally HMI (touchscreen display) via the AutoTally reader. The AutoTally server (HMI) captures downhole usage data while creating a tally for the end user  . The driller will access the system through a dedicated user interface The HMI allows the user to quickly reference asset information to see real-time asset attributes such as, ID/OD, component type, serial number, and time/rotations.</p>
        <h3>Untagged equipment</h3>
        <p>Based on block movement, hook load, and RFID events, the AutoTally system will detect sections of untagged string components and automatically add placeholders for them in the tally. Through the user interface, the user can edit these untagged string components as well as manually add untagged string components, such as the BHA, to the tally as needed.</p>
        <h3>Joined for life</h3>
        <p>Once the TracTag has been mounted to the equipment, the tag will follow the equipment's life cycle. The TracTag has been fully tested and validated through field trials and continued operations. TracTag is EX certified.</p>
        <h3>Optimal asset management</h3>
        <p><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C3188DDDE7834169AC3CC7AC28848FA9&amp;_z=z">Grant Prideco™</a> manufacturing data and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=30B1C40AEF5E43E89F9749E774FA9A68&amp;_z=z">Tuboscope</a>&nbsp;inspection data combined with AutoTally usage history enable optimal asset management for each drill string component throughout its life cycle.</p>
        <h3>Low maintenance</h3>
        <p>AutoTally is set up for remote configurations, administration, maintenance, and support.</p>
