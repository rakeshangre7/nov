        <p>The twin flapper check valve with lock-out sleeve is a coiled tubing string component that can be run in the locked out position and activated with a drop ball when required to perform as a downhole safety barrier. It prevents the back flow of well fluids into the coiled tubing.</p>
        <p>The design of the twin flapper check valve incorporates a dual sealing system in each flapper assembly for increased safety. A non-stick seat provides the primary low-pressure seal, while at higher pressure the flapper seals into a metal-to-metal arrangement.</p>
        <p>This valve is ideally suited to CT velocity string systems, allowing activation by a drop ball prior to pulling the string from the well.</p>
        
        <p>When ordering a Twin Flapper Check Valves with Lock-Out Sleeve, please specify size and thread connection.</p>
