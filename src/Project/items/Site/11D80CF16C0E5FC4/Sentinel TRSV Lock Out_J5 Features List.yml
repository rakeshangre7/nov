        <p>The NOV TRSV Lock-Out Tool (LOT) is a wireline-deployed accessory tool designed to permanently lock-open tubing-retrievable downhole safety valves that are no longer fully functional. Once the safety valve is locked open, a separate communication tool can be used to establish hydraulic communication and facilitate the insertion of a wireline-deployed, hydraulically controlled secondary safety valve.</p>
        <p>The LOT is deployed with standard wireline equipment (spang jar and weight bars) until it lands on the no-go shoulder within the safety valve. Mechanical jarring locates dogs within the safety valve internal lock profile and expands another set of dogs above the flow tube. Continued jarring compresses the power spring and drives the flow tube and flapper into the fully opened position. All power spring compression and flow tube movement are captured with internal ratchets during the operation. Once the safety valve is fully open, continued jarring permanently deforms the flow tube below the square face of the hydraulic chamber housing, preventing the flow tube from moving back into the closed position. Additional jarring collapses the tool for recovery.</p>
        <p>The LOT is a simple, robust accessory tool for permanent safety valve lock-open operations. It does not require fluid within the well or additional wellbore hydraulic pressure to successfully function. The tool design removes all lock-open-specific features within the safety valve, ultimately increasing its long-term reliability by mitigating the potential for accidental or premature lock-open or shifting during intervention operations.</p>
