        <p>The NP-1600 high-pressure pump is specifically designed to deliver high flow rates at high pressure while providing exceptional low flow rate turndown.<br />
        <br />
        This new design approach uses low-friction roller bearings rather than journal bearings to significantly enhance durability&mdash;particularly at low speeds at which other pumps using journal bearings are most vulnerable. This design also operates at a much cooler temperature. This means less lube oil system requirements, which saves weight without sacrificing unit durability.<br />
        <br />
        This pump is internally balanced so that an externally mounted counter balance does not compromise the reliability of the unit. This enhancement also provides a much smoother pump by balancing each cylinder rather than compensating from the end of the shaft. Maximum rod load is increased to 73,500 lbs (versus 58,000 lbs for competitive offerings). This enables nearly 27% increased working pressure without changing to smaller cold ends.<br />
        <br />
        The pump will accept existing cold ends and increase their capabilities.</p>
