        <p>Our pneumatic actuator&rsquo;s modular design and few components improve field performance. Designed to close upon loss of control pressure (fail-safe), this actuator's nylon-reinforced diaphragm features a large piston area to allow for a low control pressure. The maximum control pressure is 150 psi.</p>
        <p>When pneumatic control pressure enters the cylinder during operation, the extended stem travels downward, indicating the valve is open. The adjustable down-stop stops further downward movement, and the gate valve is now fully-open. The actuator is designed to maintain the valve (reverse-acting) in the open position with pneumatic pressure on top of the diaphragm.</p>
        <p>Loss of pneumatic pressure allows pressure in the valve body and spring force to move the stem and gate into the closed position.</p>
        <p>The extended stem indicates the valve is closed. The metal-to-metal seat between the actuator bonnet and lower stem serves as a secondary seal.</p>

            <li>Large diaphragm area &ndash; Permits use of a low-pressure air or gas control system. A relief valve on the cylinder acts to protect against damage to the diaphragm in case of excessive pressure increases.</li>
