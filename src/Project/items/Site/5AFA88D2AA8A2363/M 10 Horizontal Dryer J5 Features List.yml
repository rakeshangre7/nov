        <h2>The original mud recovery equipment</h2>
        <p>The mud recovery system transfers drill cuttings discharged from the primary shakers to the inlet pipe of the unit. Drill cuttings fall into the inlet pipe and are accelerated by gravity to the distribution cone. The cuttings are then evenly spread and retained on the inner circumference of the wedge wire screen by centrifugal force. Linear motion is induced axially onto the screen, which conveys the drill cuttings to the discharge end of the wedge wire screen. The M-10 horizontal dryer can reduce the oil content on drill cuttings to less than 4% (w/w).</p>
        <p>Synthetic- or oil-based mud moves through the apertures in the wedge wire screen by centrifugal force. The recovered mud then flows from the discharge point to be collected for secondary treatment. A decanting centrifuge performs the secondary treatment to separate solids from liquids. The decanter processing the mud viscosity should be monitored to ensure efficient mud recovery.</p>
        <p>The variable-frequency drive (VFD) offers increased operations efficiency and flexibility by enabling the rotations per minute (RPM) of the mud dryer screen motor to be varied from zero to a set maximum value. Run parameters are displayed on a touchscreen, also referred to as the Human Machine Interface (HMI). The touchscreen is programmed to help the operator control and monitor the screen at all times without opening the control cabinet to check the VFD. The HMI features built-in safety interlocks that communicate with the VFD to protect the centrifuge, VFD, and operating personnel.</p>
