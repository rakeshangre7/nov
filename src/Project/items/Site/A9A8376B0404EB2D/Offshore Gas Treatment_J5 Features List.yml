        <p>Our extensive portfolio of gas treatment technologies has been developed based on decades of field-based experience and extensive research by our team of subject matter experts.</p>
        <p>We move efficiently from consultancy to design and supply of components and complete processing systems&mdash;including testing, qualification, and start-up&mdash;onto operation of the field.</p>
        <p>Our system optimization analysis for greenfield and brownfield projects is backed by more than 30 years of wellstream process research, development, and operational support. Our laboratory modeling techniques and computational fluid dynamics, for example, display how to achieve peak processing performance.</p>
        <p>We provide critically important feasibility studies, concept definitions, and front-end engineering design (FEED), enabling our customers to make sound decisions based on relevant cost and time considerations.</p>
        <p>Our world-class portfolio of technologies, both standardized and custom-made, allow specialized equipment selection, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Triethylene glycol (TEG) gas dehydration</li>
            <li>Super-purifier TEG regeneration for high efficiency, low maintenance, and minimum footprint and weight</li>
            <li>Molecular sieves for versatile performance on dewpoints and sour components or mercury</li>
            <li>Amines for gas sweetening</li>
            <li>Cold processes for hydrocarbon dewpointing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Apart from consultancy, equipment delivery, and commissioning, start-up, and operational support, we also provide aftermarket services for our installed equipment, including maintenance, optimization, spare parts management, and user training.</p>
        <p>Our offering is a true end-to-end service, in which every element reflects our superior expertise and commitment to perform. Through our products and services we enable maximum value at minimum cost to our customers.</p>
        <h2>Amine gas sweetening</h2>
        <p>We provide efficient, optimized, and custom-made solutions for gas sweetening. We propose all types of amines, from conventional DEA to generic MDEA, for selective H<sub>2</sub>S removal and activated MDEA for enhanced and optimized CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S removal. For these units, the complete design is performed in-house based on our experience and expertise with the use of advanced mass-transfer-rate-based software.</p>
        <p>For specific needs, we work closely with amine process licensors to provide solutions for all types of applications, from pipeline-specific gas sweetening to tight liquid natural gas (LNG) specifications.</p>
        <p>Our extensive experience in the field of modularization is fully integrated with our process expertise to offer optimized solutions.</p>
        <h2>Hydrocarbon dewpointing</h2>
        <p>We offer complete solutions for hydrocarbon dewpointing, whether it be for pipeline specifications or for valuable liquids recovery. We offer refrigeration packages with optimized heat integration, Joule-Thompson-valve-based processes, or a turboexpander for high-performance recovery. We can propose specific adsorbents operating on short cycles for hydrocarbon dewpointing and C5+ recovery combined with gas dehydration.</p>
        <p>Our expertise in hydrate inhibition allows us to propose complete, integrated dewpoint control units with hydrate-inhibitor injection, recovery, and regeneration.</p>
        <h2>TEG regeneration and dehydration</h2>
        <p>We design and supply gas dehydration systems using TEG to absorb water from gas.</p>
        <p>High-energy recovery and low-glycol loss is achieved by our dehydration packages and modules, which are compact, low in weight, and small in footprint. Raw natural gas or wet gas can have varying degrees of water content, aerosols, and droplet sizes, so our TEG gas dehydration system reduces the water dewpoint and removes solids from the gas. This prevents hydrate formation, condensation, or corrosion in the downstream processes.</p>
