        <h2>Versatile by design</h2>
        <p>For over 65 years, Bondstrand&trade; has been a leading and trusted provider of corrosion-resistant, nonmetallic composite solutions for marine and offshore project applications. Combined with our unique range of engineering services, Bondstrand provides end users with versatile alternatives to traditional materials&mdash;including glass-reinforced epoxy (GRE) piping, fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) structures, and composite pressure vessels.</p>
        <p>We've worked on everything from FPSO and FLNG vessels to submarines, warships, and drillships, supplying miles of pipework and composite structures that saved hundreds of tons in weight and eliminated corrosion. This wide implementation is possible because with a Fiber Glass Systems composite solution, you receive the support and coverage of a global organization with a commitment to your success. With our Bondstrand product line, we're upholding a legacy of excellence as we continue to reduce your total cost of ownership.</p>
        <p>Read the full story about how we applied an advanced design and advanced manufacturing solution to the BP Clair Ridge project, saving over 700 tons in weight <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=08C76A29131F426A829945AD2CAA9C5E&amp;_z=z">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Our GRE and FRP products are lightweight, require minimal maintenance, are highly durable and corrosion resistant, and are ideally suited to extreme marine and offshore environments:</p>
