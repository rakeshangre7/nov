        <h2 style="color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;">Oasys desalination</h2>
        <p style="color: #707070; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em;">NOV has entered into an exclusive agreement with Oasys Water for a new water desalination technology. Under the agreement, NOV will be the global provider of water treatment equipment and services to the upstream oil and gas industry using Oasys’ patented forward osmosis desalination process. By treating frac flowback and produced water to freshwater quality, the unique treatment process allows the once-defined waste to be reused in drilling and completion activities or discharged to surface waters in areas where disposal options are limited.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;">Mono Solar Filtration System</h2>
        <p style="color: #707070; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em;">The Solar Filtration System is designed to remove bacteria, viruses, pathogens, and suspended solids from water to provide safe water to remote areas. It brings together the proven NOV Mono™ solar water pumping technology with GE’s Ultra Filtration technology to produce a reliable, self-cleaning filtration solution. Available with either a stationary or GPS tracking array and ranging from 150 to 350 watts, these systems can produce up to 15,000 L/D. The applications include surface water treatment, hospital water supply, emergency water supply, and village water supply. The Solar Filtration System provides its own power from solar energy, eliminating the need for diesel fuel or external electrical sources. The system is easily automated to turn on or off by float switch or pressure kit. Once the clean water tank is full, the system will turn off, conserving water and reducing wear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #707070; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">The system will turn itself back on again when more water is needed. By using a Sun-Sub™ or Sun-Ray™ pump to feed the dirty water tank, the installation requires no supplemental power.</p>
