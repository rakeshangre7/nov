        <p>Polyplaster fiberglass pipe is hand lay-up (HLU) pipe in diameters 1 to 8 in. is wound on a CAM machine up to 100 in. A variety of vinyl ester/polyester resin systems and liner thicknesses can be specified. The joint is butted and wrapped. High-resin-content, thick, reinforced liners are available in the pipe wall for severe chemical services and oxidizing acids.</p>
        <p>The high-resin-content construction of the pipe and fittings is well suited for severe chemical services as well as municipal applications. Polyplaster fiberglass pipe is highly adaptive to custom fabrication and specialty applications, including cobalt-free requirements for sodium hypochlorite and other severely aggressive oxidizers.</p>
