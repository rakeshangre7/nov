      Hint: description
      Value: |
        <p>Z-Core fiberglass pipe has outstanding corrosion resistance to aggressive solvents such as methylene chloride, acetone, dimethyl formamide, and chloroform. It also extends the boundaries for fiberglass piping in sulfuric acid service up to 98%. It is especially designed for service in severe corrosion applications in the chemical process industry and other industrial plants. Z-Core products are a propriety thermosetting resin capable of enduring severe environments such as concentrated sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hot caustic, and mixtures of acids, solvents, and bases.</p>
        <p>Its longer life means a reduction in maintenance and replacement costs. Compared to metallic piping systems, Z-Core pipe can be installed easier and faster, and heavy equipment is seldom required. A considerable savings on total installed cost may be achieved because less labor and equipment are needed.</p>
        <p>Z-Core pipe also offers the advantage of light weight. For example, 4 in. pipe weighs 3.5 lb/ft compared to 10.8 lb/ft for 4-in. Schedule 40 stainless steel pipe. Therefore, a 20-ft length of Z-Core pipe weighs only 70 lb, while the same length of Schedule 40 weighs 216 lb&mdash;or three times the weight of Z-Core pipe.</p>
        <p>Z-Core proprietary curing agents coupled with a premium epoxy resin base gives Z-Core its outstanding corrosion resistance to aggressive solvents and concentrated acids.</p>
