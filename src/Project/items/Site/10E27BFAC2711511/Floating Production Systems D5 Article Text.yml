        <h2>Concept Selection and Pre-FEED</h2>
        <p>In the concept selection phase, together with our clients we create a well-informed comparison of the different concepts available such as performing a combined mooring and riser analysis to exploit efficiencies in the combined system design.</p>
        <h2>Front-End Engineering Design (FEED)</h2>
        <p>Once a concept has been selected, our team of naval architects, structural engineers, mooring experts, process engineers, integration managers, and design engineers work together to develop innovative solutions for complex projects. Our people are our strongest asset and deliver the highest quality of work for the success of our partners.</p>
        <h2>Project Execution</h2>
        <p>We are your single source throughout the entire project execution process. From designing and building the equipment to installation and integration at the shipyards, we reduce the risk for our customers, giving them a predictable budget and schedule.&nbsp;<br />
        With the recent acquisition of Profab and our new Flexibles plant in Brazil, we are expanding our ownership of the entire value chain to include fabrication and integration. We provide you with more certainty and ensure highest quality of equipment and service are delivered.</p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>Our truly disconnectable turret, the Submerged Turret Production (STP&trade;), is designed to be installed at the field, together with the mooring and risers, regardless of the FPSO unit schedule. We are able to decouple the shipyard and field installation schedules to optimize time and costs, promoting efficiencies to your offshore installation campaign.</p>
        <h2>Operations</h2>
        <p>Operational expenses are hard to predict. With a reputation for producing the most advanced, reliable equipment, we can help you achieve cost-efficient operations.</p>
        <p>Our disconnectable mooring system allows the vessel to easily return to the shipyard for any planned and unplanned maintenance. During harsh weather conditions, the vessel can quickly move out of harm&rsquo;s way by disconnecting the buoy&mdash;protecting personnel, equipment, and the environment.</p>
        <p>We have also developed a unique intelligent monitoring system for flexible pipes. Using fiber-optic technology, we can now help operators avoid unplanned production shutdowns, minimize hydrate formation and waxing, and monitor system configuration integrity. The system entails a suite of temperature and strain monitoring options that provide real-time event detection as well as long-term data collection. The data provide accurate information on the integrity of the flexible pipe systems during service. This monitoring system constitutes an important part of an overall general-purpose integrity mooring system.</p>
        <h2>Redeployment</h2>
        <p>We design and build our equipment with redeployment in mind. We understand the challenges in floating production, and that&rsquo;s why we are a partner that helps you plan ahead to reduce time and costs and to deliver peace of mind. We focus on lasting production success.</p>
