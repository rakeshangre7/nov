      Value: "<p>Geosteering and precise wellbore placement are critical as the industry continues to seek improved cost efficiency and higher returns on drilling campaigns. Rotary steerable systems (RSS) are a driving technology behind accurately placing wellbores in production sweet spots, but the cost of the systems has been a barrier to entry for capital-constrained companies without the resources of their larger peers. Acting as an unbiased, third-party technology provider, we developed our RSS technology to make innovation available to independent directional drilling companies and national oil companies, the latter having historically been limited to the larger service providers.</p>"
