        <p>We provide a large spectrum of technical support and drilling rig service levels that our customers can select and scale appropriately to achieve their operational goals.</p>
        <h2>Remote technical support</h2>
        <p>We know that in this industry time can be critical, so our team of multi-skilled technicians is available around the clock to assist with any problems. To return you to normal operations faster, we use our web-based application Tracker to record, manage, and resolve your issues. We also connect with rigs via our eHawk&trade; Remote Support, a premium, on-demand support and diagnostic drilling rig service. Globally integrated support centers in the US and Norway enable fast and effective collaboration with your rig crew or shore-based support team. When called upon, eHawk can be granted remote live access to your rig data to quickly see what is happening, clarify system operation, or troubleshoot your NOV equipment. It links you with our subject matter experts and design engineers to answer your questions and overcome your challenges.</p>
        <p>For 24/7 technical support, call 281-569-3050.</p>
        <h2>Field-equipped for drilling rig service</h2>

        <h2>TrackerVision real-wear technology</h2>
        <p>TrackerVision&trade; is a wearable technology offering that brings together software, communication devices, and special hardware to increase the effectiveness of NOV drilling rig service technicians on land rigs and offshore vessels.

        <h2>Installation and commissioning</h2>
