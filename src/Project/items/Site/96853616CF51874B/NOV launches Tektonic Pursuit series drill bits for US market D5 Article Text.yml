        <p>As the US drilling market continues to evolve, we see operators and drillers pursuing target zones that are deeper and farther than ever before. Pursuit drill bits are designed to enhance drilling efficiency, enabling operators and drillers to complete these intervals faster and at lower cost. The drill bits use computer analysis of torque response along with a torque reduction component to improve directional control and reduce sliding times. In addition, Pursuit drill bits are designed with material improvements that deliver increased strength and durability, and cutter life has been enhanced by minimizing thermal degradation. ReedHycalog&rsquo;s industry-leading <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EDFE5F84FC7649F582650EF6969B59E4&amp;_z=z">ION&trade; cutters</a>&nbsp;are an essential part of Pursuit series bits, with formation-specific cutters and new cutter shapes being developed to overcome challenging characteristics of specific applications found in the US.</p>
        <p>The Pursuit series is the most recent addition to our regional drill bit product lines, which includes <a href="-/media/20dc2f7a9f97442684c70c56ad9701e2.ashx">Falcon</a>&nbsp;(Middle East and North Africa), <a href="-/media/f5f3048031b74f42bbfd09d21666ceb3.ashx">Fuego</a>&nbsp;(Latin America), and Redline (Canada). While the Pursuit series drill bits are tailored for the US market, the design tools, technology, and philosophy can be adapted worldwide.</p>
