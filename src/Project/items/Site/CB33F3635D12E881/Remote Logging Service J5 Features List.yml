        <p>Our remote logging service provides 24/7 monitoring of our Gas Watch&trade; III detection systems and RigSense&trade; rig site information system to ensure maximum uptime and accurate depth referencing for gas shows. Along with 24/7 customer support, rate of penetration (ROP) gas logs and data files are generated and delivered twice a day.</p>
        <p>Our remote logging service is a proven alternative to mud logging and reduces your operational costs.&nbsp;The service monitors all gas readings in real time and will contact the service center if any problems arise to reduce downtime. Our loggers will help maintain quality data and interpretations you expect with full-service mudlogging.</p>
        <p>The Remote Logging Center provides bi-daily reporting of lag-corrected ROP gas logs. Depending on gas detector selection and operational requirements, the ROP gas log may include ROP, total gas, normalized gas, C1 and C3 curves, lag correction, major events, and service and repair reports. Logs are displayed in MD and may include true vertical depth (TVD) reference and hole trajectory. Measurement-while-drilling (MWD), logging-while-drilling (LWD), geological descriptions, and lithology may be included with composite log services.</p>
