        <p>To ensure compliance with the latest industry requirements for thread protection, look to Tuboscope MSI Pipe Protection Technologies’ MaxX™ thread protectors for a full range of maximum protection. Our MaxX design is a completely re-invented thread protector and the result of an intense product development effort by the MSI team. MaxX thread protectors are designed to fully comply with API standards and are available in both liftable and non-liftable options.</p>
        <p>From an all-new plastic resin formulation and the use of rib and stiffener support elements, to durable pads and diaphragms, MaxX protectors are designed to withstand any conditions commonly seen in the oil and gas industry, including radically extreme temperatures and severe impact scenarios. MaxX protectors always perform and protect, and they are backed by stringent analysis and thorough testing from an independent third-party resource. We can confidently claim that our MaxX thread protectors are the best on the market for both API compliance and full plastic protection.</p>
