        <p>"This is a significant award for NOV and the largest North Sea project in our history," said Michael Hart, President, Subsea Production Systems. "Throughout the history of the group, the North Sea has always been a key area of focus and commitment. For more than 20 years we have set many firsts and delivered a grand total of more than 210 km of flexible pipes for installation offshore Norway. NOV would like to thank Vår Energi AS and Ocean Installer for their confidence in our ability to contribute to the success of the Balder Future project."</p>
        
        <p>Håvard Strand, Chief Operating Officer at Ocean Installer said, "Ocean Installer is pleased to place such a significant subcontract with Flexibles. This is a complex delivery and critical to the overall success of the Balder Future project. We look forward to working in close cooperation with NOV over the coming years to successfully and safely deliver this project."</p>
        
        <p>We are grateful to be working on the Balder Future project with Ocean Installer and Vår Energi AS and are excited to help contribute to the success of the project.</p>
