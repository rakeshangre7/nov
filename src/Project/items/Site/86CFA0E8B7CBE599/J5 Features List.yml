        <h2>Designed and configured for remote temporary plant installations.</h2>
        <p>We design and manufacture systems to meet ASME, DOT, USCG, or other applicable design requirements. We have built bulk systems and vessels for over 30 years. We have the manufacturing technology, experience, and skilled craftsmen to ensure superior quality that meets your requirements.</p>
        <h3>Control skid</h3>
        <p>Our custom Wilco&trade; portable cement bulk plant control skid consists of a climate-controlled control room with a control panel, storage area, air compressor, receiver tank, and generator.</p>
        <h3>Bulk plant system</h3>
        <p>Utilizing our engineering experience, we have developed a portable alternative for your bulk plant needs. This complete system comprises bulk storage tanks, scale tanks, blend tanks, waste tanks, dust collectors, electronic weighing system and a scale system, and pressure additive hopper to ensure proper storage and precise blending of bulk material.</p>
        <p><strong>Bulk storage tank</strong> &ndash; Our engineering team can customize the number and size of ASME Code bulk storage tanks (either 1,710 or 2,100 ft<sup>3</sup>). With all the hardware, these tanks are designed to load and unload via pneumatic conveying efficiently.</p>
        <p><strong>Bulk scale tank and electronic weighing system</strong> &ndash; The scale tank, along with the electronic weighing system, allows for precise measurement of bulk cement and additives for the job design requirements. With 60,000-lb capacity and 400-ft<sup>3</sup> volume, cement can be quickly measured using a digital indicator, ticket printer, load cells, and interconnecting wiring. The scale system is approved for the measurement of bulk material weight for sale.</p>
        <p><strong>Bulk blend tank</strong> &ndash; The bulk blend tank allows for homogeneous mixing of the bulk cement and additives before offloading into bulk haulers that transport the cement blend to the wellsite. The 400-ft<sup>3</sup> ASME Code tank includes a complete aeration system to fluidize bulk material for pneumatic discharge.</p>
        <p><strong>Waste tank</strong> &ndash; The waste tank allows for the storage of any unused bulk waste or trash cement, providing adequate storage volume up to 400 ft<sup>3</sup> until the material can be hauled off for disposal.</p>
        <p><strong>Dust collector</strong> &ndash; Our Wilco dust control package eliminates dust in the portable bulk system with minimal maintenance.</p>
        <p><strong>Pressure additive hopper </strong>&ndash; Use our additive hopper to convey dry bulk materials into the scale tank pneumatically.</p>
