        <p>NOV&rsquo;s subsea storage unit (SSU) technology increases the value for field developments and reduces the need for topside modifications by storing water on the seabed. This storage system is energy efficient with a low environmental footprint, and it is developed based on experience from existing storage solutions to be a competitive alternative for future field developments requiring temporary storage.</p>
        <p>Subsea produced water treatment technology is maturing, and large subsea water tanks are under development as a last separation stage to achieve high water cleanliness and robustness. The Produced Water Treatment Tank (PWTT) system is designed to achieve a buffer volume to both smoothen out variation in the outlet water quality and to achieve the required water quality of dispersed oil-in-water at 30 ppm or lower. The treated water could either be reinjected into the reservoir or discharged to sea.</p>
        <p>The system is designed with high residence time (24 hours) for settling of solid particles and flotation of oil droplets by gravimetric separation to maximize the regularity of operation. Finding the best treatment solution for produced water technology is important, and there is a need to develop a more efficient and suitable system to achieve higher water cleanliness. The technology aims to eliminate surface facilities associated with water treatment to reduce overall development costs.</p>
        <p>The PWTT system consists of a sand accumulator and a PWTT unit. The PWTT consists of a subsea storage unit (SSU) structure that employs the concept of a membrane protected by a dome for storage on the seafloor. It can be placed at any water depth and is adjustable in size depending on operator needs during the development and expansion of the field. The seawater outside the dome surrounds the membrane through free-flow seawater openings in the dome, such that the hydrostatic pressure acts directly on the stored fluid. A subsea sand accumulator included in the system is designed to remove sand from the produced water stream before the sand can cause problems with downstream equipment.</p>

      Value: |
        <p>With an increase in challenging offshore environments and additional well tie-ins, the need for more effective offshore separation technologies is greater than ever, especially for produced water management. The amount of produced water, contaminants, and concentrations can differ significantly over the life of a field, so a more efficient and suitable system is required to achieve higher water cleanliness.
        </p>
        <p>Subsea produced water treatment technology is maturing, and large, horizontal subsea water tanks are under development as a last separation stage to achieve high water cleanliness and production stability. Our produced water treatment tank (PWTT) system is designed to achieve a large buffer volume to smooth out variations in the outlet water quality (from upstream separator) and to achieve the required water quality of dispersed oil-in-water at 15 ppm or lower. This process is not being achieved with today&rsquo;s technology, as the treated water is directly discharged to sea or re-injected into the reservoir.
        </p>
        <p>Our system consists of two horizontal PWTTs, a sand management system, power and control system (including pressure and buoyancy protection mechanisms), fluid transfer system, and a cluster frame. The PWTT system is designed with the appropriate residence time for settling of solid particles and flotation of oil droplets. The system is gravity based and does not require any chemicals, making it environmentally friendly. The technology also aims to eliminate surface facilities associated with water treatment, reducing overall investment and operational costs.
        </p>
        <p>The PWTT functions at a low operating pressure (above ambient hydrostatic pressure) with a gas phase to improve separation performance. This allows it to be placed anywhere on the seabed and at any water depth, depending on operator needs during the development and expansion of the field. Furthermore, the system is designed with oil-reject and gas-reject lines as well as a sand management system connected to an upstream sand accumulator, making the PWTT even more efficient and reliable.
        </p>
        <p>Our PWTT is the ideal solution for additional well tie-ins, deepwater processing, and long tie-backs. As an economical and viable alternative to floating production storage and offloading vessels, the PWTT can be used in conjunction with our other water treatment technologies, including the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=03196535B76849CEB8D2C053B7B6311B&amp;_z=z">Seabox&trade; system</a>&nbsp;and our subsea storage unit for oil and condensates, helping to successfully move your processing infrastructure to the seabed.</p>
