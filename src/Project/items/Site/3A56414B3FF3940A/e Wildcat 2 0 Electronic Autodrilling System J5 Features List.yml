        <p>The M/D Totco™ e-Wildcat 2.0 electronic autodrilling system delivers superior performance, including improved bit wear, increased safety, enhanced rig efficiency, and a higher quality wellbore.
        </p>
        <p>The e-Wildcat 2.0 system is the first universal autodriller offering for the conventional rig market. It can be installed in addition to a RigSense™ 3.21 or later rental system, or as a small footprint, standalone solution to work with an existing rig-owned EDR. Both configurations provide constant force and payout to generate a higher quality wellbore and optimize drilling parameters. The system smoothly controls payout via brake handle, using precise stepper motor technology and multiple-parameter control. In addition to Delta-P technology and proven reliability, our e-Wildcat 2.0 system expands control parameters to include rate of penetration (ROP), weight on bit (WOB), and torque. The Time Drill feature allows drilling at a specific rate, addressing specialized requirements of casing sidewall milling and sidetrack operations within multilateral openhole wellbores.
        </p>
        <p>The robust design of our e-Wildcat 2.0 system ensures maximum uptime while delivering the performance needed in your conventional and unconventional drilling operation.
        </p>
        <p>The e-Wildcat 2.0 system offers more information at a glance through the RigSense system, an easier setup, and intuitive operation via the driller’s screen, allowing you to maximize the potential of our powerful autodriller.</p>
