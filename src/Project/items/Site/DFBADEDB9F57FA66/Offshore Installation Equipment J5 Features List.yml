        <h2>Upending Control Systems</h2>
        <p>We provide safe and reliable products for righting and lowering jackets to the seabed. Our complete Upending Control Systems (UCS) include flood and vent valves, tube bundles, the Upending Control Centre (UCC), flotation tank release systems, rigging release systems, HPU&rsquo;s, umbilical and umbilical winches. We also provide Template Levelling Systems (TLS) for accurate positioning control of subsea drilling templates.</p>
        <h2>Upending Control Systems</h2>
        <p>Depending on the size and weight of the jacket due to the installation water depth and topside capacity, a typical jacket structure can have more than 100 hydraulically actuated ball valves mounted in air tight compartments within the jacket legs and buoyancy tanks. Coordinating the opening and closing of the flood and vent ball valves to provide accurate active ballasting into each compartment is key to a safe and successful jacket installation. The operation of the upending control system is manual from the UCC, which is mounted on the jacket above the water line. The UCC is designed to protect the operating equipment from slam forces during launch and is connected by up to 4km of tube bundles to the flood and vent valves.</p>
        <h2>Template Levelling Systems</h2>
        <p>Drilling templates are used to allow pre-drilling operations to be carried out prior to the installation of the Drilling Platform. NOV installs, tests and commissions the hydraulic pipework, panels and cylinders on the template structure prior to carrying out a rigorous land based witness and acceptance test procedure.</p>
        <h2>Pin Release System</h2>
        <p>Typical lifting beam connections for a jacket lifted from a barge by crane and placed in the sea before being trimmed and lowered can be provided by NOV. This can be supplied independently or as part of a full turnkey package including a UCS.</p>
