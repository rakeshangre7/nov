        <p>The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=23EA03EED6D04842BEA09FE5A6206C1B&amp;_z=z">Wilco pumper</a>&nbsp;uses two innovative Volvo 665-horsepower diesel engines with Tier 4 emission controls that do not require a regeneration system. Eliminating the regeneration system reduces downtime and enables simpler operation of the pumper. The unit also has Allison 4700 series transmissions to drive triplex pumps that efficiently push cement downhole. Combining a patented, high-energy recirculating cement mix head with our Rolligon&trade; CAM&trade; system delivers blended cement slurry at accurate densities up to 22 lb/gal (2,640 kg/m^3^), while a precision-engineered hydraulic system powers Mission&trade; Sandmaster&trade; centrifugal pumps, mixing agitators, cooling-heat exchangers, and pump lubrication systems.</p>
        <p>In addition to manufacturing new cement pumping equipment, we also re-manufacture and rebuild current cement pumping equipment per customer specifications and budgets. Through this program, we are able to save our customers money by assessing their equipment and replacing or rebuilding it to "like new" condition.</p>
