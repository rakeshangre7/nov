        <p>Our subsea water treatment technology can serve different types of field applications ranging from greenfield to brownfields, both in shallow and deep waters across the world,&nbsp; either with a stand-alone Seabox&trade; subsea water treatment module or together with subsea filtration and membrane solutions. The modules can also be combined with topside processing plants.</p>
        <h2>Waterflooding</h2>
        <p>The Seabox module assists in optimizing the operator's waterflooding strategy. By disinfecting the raw seawater and sedimentation, the Seabox module provides sterile water with a particle size down to approximately 8.5&micro;m. The module can be placed next to the wellhead, injecting water to the reservoir to improve the sweep efficiency and provide pressure support for enhanced oil recovery. </p>
        <p>The Seabox module can inject water straight into the well without an injection pump. This is a solution called dump flood. When production has been done exclusively by depletion, reservoirs are often left with a pressure considerably lower than the hydrostatic pressure. This allows for injecting water without adding pressure with a pump. The injected water can improve the recovery of oil by gravity itself. </p>
        <h2>Water intake</h2>
        <p>The Seabox module can be added as a pretreatment step to an existing topside facility water processing plant. The module will be located subsea at the foot of the facility, feeding water to the existing processing plant. The Seabox module feeds disinfected and particle-reduced water topside for continued water treatment step injection or feeding a topside injector.</p>
        <p>Adding a Seabox module as a pretreatment step can improve the filtration lifetime, reducing the maintenance intervals and downtime on the topside facility and reducing the biocide usage. This is an alternative for a rapidly improved oil recovery strategy when needed, optimizing the use of an existing facility while getting more out of the reservoir.</p>
        <h2>Tieback</h2>
        <p>Our subsea water treatment technology enables the development of marginal assets through subsea tiebacks, allowing water injection next to the injection well. By adding a Seabox module or further tailoring of the water through the different SWIT&trade; applications, the operator is given the freedom needed to otherwise develop marginal assets. Our water treatment technology eliminates the need for long, high-pressure pipelines to transfer water to the well. The water treatment solutions are decoupled from the topside infrastructure, enabling larger step-outs and making water treatment an option for marginal fields.</p>
        <p>In addition, with the low power consumption and zero added chemical and flexible step-out, the Seabox subsea water treatment module can improve recovery rates for that marginal discovery. The solution offered also enables the operator to tailor the water quality for injection on marginal assets where scaling issues occur or the need to alter the wettability in the reservoir is required.</p>
        <p>We are capable of making water injection possible on marginal field developments, enabling flexible tieback solutions.</p>

With expertise in produced water and seawater treatment, we understand the process flow detail and develop the optimal solution.</p>
        <h3>The purpose of subsea seawater treatment
        </h3>
        <p>Our subsea water treatment technologies can serve a broad range of applications. Typically, our oil and gas industry customers are interested in using the treated water for water injection purposes to optimize recovery from oil reservoirs. Optimized water treatment addresses typical reservoir issues, providing the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improves injectivity control</li>
            <li>Reduces H<sub>2</sub>S souring potential</li>
            <li>Avoids scale formation</li>
            <li>Enhances oil recovery through altered wettability properties
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our Seabox&trade; and SWIT&trade; systems address water treatment challenges by enhancing the performance of existing topside facilities, enabling unmanned water injection, maximizing tie-back value, and improving reservoir value by providing smart water for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and a significantly reduced carbon footprint.
        </p>
        <h3>Strategic drivers for field development
        </h3>
        <p>Subsea water treatment address several of the current market needs, as summarized below.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HSE - </strong>Enables unmanned field developments to reduce needs for offshore manning, service consumables, and hazardous chemicals.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Improve field economics - </strong>Increases oil recovery factor by adding cost-efficient, sustainable and reusable technology, decoupled from host.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability and carbon footprint </strong>- Reduces power demand by up to 85% compared to traditional solutions, depending upon required water specification and the equipment location&rsquo;s water depth. In addition, usage of biocides and chemicals are drastically reduced, and the overall carbon footprint is reduced due to the absence of a requirement for a host facility and long pipelines.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Customer value </strong>- Improves the value stream from existing facilities and/or enables unmanned field developments and tiebacks with water injection. Reduces the need for topside host capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX), specifically on offshore manning, chemicals use, and power consumption.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Industrialization</strong> - Modular building blocks and components provide water of any quality and quantity without major project-specific reengineering. Equipment can potentially be reused for future projects.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Digitalization -</strong> By condition monitoring, analysis, and trending, the operations can be monitored from shore and a condition-based intervention supply chain can be realized, thereby optimizing the field operational strategy in terms of required offshore manning, system availability, and reduced need for sparing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Application of different seawater treatment stages
        </h3>
        <p>Several water treatment process stages can be applied to achieve the desired water quality results. Solutions may consist of either one (or multiple) Seabox module(s) or together with one (or multiple) subsea ultrafiltration and nanomembrane modules.
        </p>
        <h3>Offshore field development application options</h3>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>The subsea water treatment solution can be configured to the desired water quality and quantity, and the solutions can be combined with existing or new equipment, whether topside or subsea.</p>

        <h3>The purpose of subsea seawater treatment
        </h3>
        <p>Our subsea water treatment technologies can serve a broad range of applications. Typically, our oil and gas industry customers are interested in using the treated water for water injection purposes to optimize recovery from oil reservoirs. Optimized water treatment addresses typical reservoir issues, providing the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improves injectivity control</li>
            <li>Reduces H<sub>2</sub>S souring potential</li>
            <li>Avoids scale formation</li>
            <li>Enhances oil recovery through altered wettability properties
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our Seabox&trade; and SWIT&trade; systems address water treatment challenges by enhancing the performance of existing topside facilities, enabling unmanned water injection, maximizing tie-back value, and improving reservoir value by providing smart water for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and a significantly reduced carbon footprint.
        </p>
        <h3>Strategic drivers for field development
        </h3>
        <p>Subsea water treatment address several of the current market needs, as summarized below.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HSE - </strong>Enables unmanned field developments to reduce needs for offshore manning, service consumables, and hazardous chemicals.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Improve field economics - </strong>Increases oil recovery factor by adding cost-efficient, sustainable and reusable technology, decoupled from host.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability and carbon footprint </strong>- Reduces power demand by up to 85% compared to traditional solutions, depending upon required water specification and the equipment location&rsquo;s water depth. In addition, usage of biocides and chemicals are drastically reduced, and the overall carbon footprint is reduced due to the absence of a requirement for a host facility and long pipelines.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Customer value </strong>- Improves the value stream from existing facilities and/or enables unmanned field developments and tiebacks with water injection. Reduces the need for topside host capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX), specifically on offshore manning, chemicals use, and power consumption.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Industrialization</strong> - Modular building blocks and components provide water of any quality and quantity without major project-specific reengineering. Equipment can potentially be reused for future projects.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Digitalization -</strong> By condition monitoring, analysis, and trending, the operations can be monitored from shore and a condition-based intervention supply chain can be realized, thereby optimizing the field operational strategy in terms of required offshore manning, system availability, and reduced need for sparing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Application of different seawater treatment stages
        </h3>
        <p>Several water treatment process stages can be applied to achieve the desired water quality results. Solutions may consist of either one (or multiple) Seabox module(s) or together with one (or multiple) subsea ultrafiltration and nanomembrane modules.
        </p>
        <h3>Offshore field development application options</h3>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>The subsea water treatment solution can be configured to the desired water quality and quantity, and the solutions can be combined with existing or new equipment, whether topside or subsea.</p>

        <p style="color: #707070; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; text-align: left; letter-spacing: normal;">The injection of treated water into the well without an injection pump is one of the most simplistic applications from a system perspective. This applies when reservoir pressure is lower than the hydrostatic pressure from the water column in the wellbore. Consequently, this condition allows for injecting water without adding pressure from a pump.</p>
