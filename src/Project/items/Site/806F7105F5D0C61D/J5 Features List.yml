        On many types of coiled tubing jobs, there are requirements for pumping both fluid and nitrogen, but not often in extremely large volumes. Previously, this required two separate pieces of equipment to be brought to the job site, even though one or the other might see limited use. This also usually meant an extra truck or trailer, an extra driver, and more time to rig-up two separate units, which added cost to the job.<br />
        <br />
        Our units require only one piece of equipment to be brought to do the job of pumping both nitrogen and fluid. The fluid side of the unit consists of an independent power unit, triplex fluid pump, 10-bbl tank, two centrifugal pumps, and discharge manifolds. The nitrogen side of the unit consists of an independent power unit, liquid nitrogen storage tank, nitrogen boost pump, nitrogen triplex pump, water bath vaporizer, and discharge manifolds. Both the nitrogen and fluid sides of the unit are controlled from a common, climate-controlled cabin located on the unit. The unit is on a purpose-built drop-deck rail trailer for reduced weight and is equipped with storage accommodations for treating iron.
