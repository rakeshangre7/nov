        <h2>When the heat&rsquo;s on, our mobile solution keeps your mud cool.</h2>
        <p>Elevated and fluctuating downhole temperatures and pressures can negatively impact mud properties, hole cleaning, and critical downhole measurements and tool life while increasing overall mud costs and nonproductive time (NPT). These problems are especially pronounced on land rigs or land drilling operations for which water is not readily available as a cooling medium, and mud chillers must be designed to effectively dissipate drilling fluid heat within a closed-loop cooling circuit.</p>
        <p>Our mobile, fully automated land mud chiller relies on specially designed twin-plate pack heat exchangers as well as proven air-blast and chiller technologies to continuously cool drilling fluid in a single pass. With its innovative design, the land mud chiller achieves efficient cooling even with elevated ambient temperatures and without the need for an external water source.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As downhole temperatures rise, the Brandt Tundra Max land mud chiller effectively reduces and stabilizes synthetic, diesel, and water-based drilling fluid temperatures, leading to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced NPT by eliminating trip time required to change out or protect subsurface tools.</li>
            <li>Improved accuracy of subsurface measuring tools.</li>
            <li>Improved drilling fluid performance and reduced costs associated with chemical additives.</li>
            <li>Reduced HSE risks associated with high temperature returns.</li>
            <li>Extended life for both surface and subsurface equipment.</li>
