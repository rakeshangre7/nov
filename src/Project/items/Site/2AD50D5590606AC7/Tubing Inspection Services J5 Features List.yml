        <p>Despite stringent mill quality control programs, new oilfield tubulars can still contain manufacturing process defects and incur damage during handling and transit, making a thorough inspection program critical. Regular inspection of tubing ensures pipe is fit-for-purpose, optimizes tubing performance, extends run life, and helps you identify critical downhole conditions that can shorten tubing life or result in a costly failure.</p>
        <p>Inspection of new tubing is performed in one of our Tuboscope facilities around the world.</p>
        <p>All inspections are performed by ASNT-qualified Level I and II inspectors using Tuboscope’s proven technologies, proprietary inspection equipment, and software.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Manufacturing defects we identify in new tubing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Seams and overlaps</li>
            <li>Rolled-in slugs and pits</li>
            <li>Longitudinal cracks</li>
            <li>Transverse cracks</li>
            <li>Thin wall/eccentricity</li>
            <li>Hardness variations</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Tuboscope equipment used for in-plant inspection:<br />
        </strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>TruScan™andTruscope™<strong> </strong>– A full-body ultrasonic (UT) system measuring wall and detecting defects at multiple orientations</li>
            <li>TruPhase™ 360°<strong> </strong>– 2D Phased Array UT technology that uses a single two-dimensional Array to transmit multidirectional ultrasonic beams in a single shot for simultaneous flaw detection</li>
            <li>TruScan PA – Phased Array system that identifies pipe flaws at multiple orientations along with over 100% UT wall coverage for greater consistency and repeatability</li>
            <li>TruscopeAS™– Single-pass, full-body UT and EMI inspection</li>
            <li>Amalog™ – Detects longitudinal defects such as laps, seams, and gouges</li>
            <li>Sonoscope™ – Detects transverse defects and three-dimensional defects such as pitting and holes</li>
            <li>Wall Data<strong>&nbsp;</strong>– Per joint spreadsheet providing minimum, maximum, and average wall values</li>
            <li>Wall Profile<strong>&nbsp;</strong>– Per joint spreadsheet providing minimum, maximum, and average wall values at selected segments along the length of the pipe</li>
            <li>Wall Mapping<strong> </strong>– Complete recording of all wall values</li>
            <li>Laser OD Measuring<strong>&nbsp;</strong>– Outside diameter (OD) measurement system</li>
            <li>OD Measuring/Wall Mapping<strong>&nbsp;</strong>– Wall, OD, inside diameter (ID), volumetric value, estimated weight per foot, and ovality</li>

        <p>Despite stringent mill quality control programs, new oilfield tubulars can still contain manufacturing process defects and incur damage during handling and transit, making a thorough inspection program critical. Regular inspection of tubing ensures pipe is fit-for-purpose, optimizes tubing performance, extends run life, and helps you identify critical downhole conditions that can shorten tubing life or result in a costly failure.</p>
        <p>Inspection of new tubing is performed in one of our Tuboscope facilities around the world.</p>
        <p>All inspections are performed by ASNT-qualified Level I and II inspectors using Tuboscope&rsquo;s proven technologies, proprietary inspection equipment, and software.</p>
        <h3 class="J5-features-list__headline">Manufacturing defects we identify in new tubing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Seams and overlaps</li>

            <li>TruPhase&trade; 360&deg; &ndash; 2D Phased Array UT technology that uses a single two-dimensional Array to transmit multidirectional ultrasonic beams in a single shot for simultaneous flaw detection</li>
            <li>TruScan PA &ndash; Phased Array system that identifies pipe flaws at multiple orientations along with over 100% UT wall coverage for greater consistency and repeatability</li>
            <li>TruscopeAS&trade; &ndash; Single-pass, full-body UT and EMI inspection</li>
            <li>Amalog&trade; &ndash; Detects longitudinal defects such as laps, seams, and gouges</li>
            <li>Sonoscope&trade; &ndash; Detects transverse defects and three-dimensional defects such as pitting and holes</li>
            <li>Wall Data &ndash; Per joint spreadsheet providing minimum, maximum, and average wall values</li>
            <li>Wall Profile &ndash; Per joint spreadsheet providing minimum, maximum, and average wall values at selected segments along the length of the pipe</li>
            <li>Wall Mapping &ndash; Complete recording of all wall values</li>
