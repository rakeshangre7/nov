        <p>Tuboscope MSI&rsquo;s Rhino&trade; tubular handling systems have provided a efficient, cost-effective method for safely transporting tubular products in offshore and onshore applications. Our Rhino product has been the preferred system for preventing damage to expensive chrome-alloy tubulars for decades. Load-tested frames are available for a variety of pipe sizes, and our technology is certified and DNV approved.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>MSI Pipe Protection Technologies pioneered composite frames in 1978, and some original frames are still in service.</li>
            <li>The Rhino system is designed to DNVGL-ST-0378/BS EN 12079 type approval.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Efficient</h2>
        <p><strong>Wide, elastomeric bearing surfaces keep tubes apart, immobile, and free from any damage<strong></strong></strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Free-draining and self-drying Rhino systems eliminate standing water contact and inhibits pipe corrosion.</li>
            <li>Reduced stacking time; stock control, inspection, and drifting made easy.</li>
            <li>All pipes, particularly high-chrome design, are maintained in pristine condition at the lowest possible cost.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Durable</h2>
        <p><strong>The Rhino system ensures that your initial investment will last for years<strong></strong></strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The steel/elastomer construction gives long life even in the most severe conditions.</li>
            <li>Built beyond all safety recommendations to ensure the frames withstand impact and rugged handling.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Safe</h2>
        <p><strong>Each frame set is designed to safely lift and handle far more weight than it will ever carry<strong></strong></strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Over-engineered Rhino strength not only keeps your stock and frames free from damage, it also ensures safety during handling for the crew, the transport used, and the public at large.</li>

        <li>Over-engineered strength built into frames for added safety</li>
        <li>Ability to break down frames after pipe run frees up valuable space on rig floor</li>
        <li>Broken down frames offload approximately 20-plus sets of frames in one-half height</li>
        <li>Safe and easy system for yard staff to load, saving time and requiring less effort</li>
