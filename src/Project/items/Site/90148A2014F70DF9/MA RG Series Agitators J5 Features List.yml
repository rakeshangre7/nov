        <h2>MA-RG&nbsp;Series</h2>
        <p>The skid mounted MA-RG agitator is compact, and its low profile reduces headroom requirements and provides more layout space on top of the tanks. The gearbox is a triple-reduction helical-bevel gear drive system that reduces the rotational speed of the motor to drive the impeller(s). Up to 95% mechanical efficiency helps reduce horsepower requirements.</p>
        <h2>Impellers</h2>
        <p>Impellers are available with flat blades (radial flow), contour blades (axial flow), and canted blades (radial/axial flow). The impellers are sized according to tank volume and expected duty. Active mud system compartments—such as solids removal sections, mud mixing sections, and slug pits, which need a higher shear force to produce immediate mixing—are another consideration in impeller sizing.</p>
        <h2>Shafts</h2>
        <p>Several types of shafts are offered. Mild steel shafts are cut to length and joined to the gearbox output shaft with a rigid coupling. Solid shafts are keyed at the bottom for impeller height adjustment. Hollow pipe shafts are available for deep tanks. They are supplied in flanged sections and bolted together, making them ideal for limited lifting height.</p>
        <p>Contact your NOV representative for selection and size based on tank geometry for optimal mixing and suspension in each compartment.</p>
