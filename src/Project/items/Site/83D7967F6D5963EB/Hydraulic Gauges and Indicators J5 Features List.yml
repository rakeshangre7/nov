        <h2>Weight indicators</h2>
        <p>M/D Totco™ weight indicators set the standards for quality, accuracy, and reliability against which all others are judged. We offer weight indicator models designed to work in conjunction with all industry-standard deadline anchors using either tension or compression hydraulic load cells. Indicator systems are supplied as either portable box-mount instrument systems or panel-mounted as part of a driller’s console. Each system accurately senses tension in the deadline and uses this to indicate hook load and weight on bit.</p>
        <h2>Single/dual-pointer gauges</h2>
        <p>M/D Totco remote pressure gauge systems feature an easy-to-read 6-in. gauge and a heavy-duty gauge protector. The gauges are fluid-filled to reduce the effects of shock, vibration, and corrosion and to eliminate glass frosting. Each gauge includes an adjustable damper so that pointer sensitivity can be controlled. While available in both single- and dual-pointer models, our dual-pointer version offers a 4:1 sensitivity over the single pointer.</p>
        <h2>Tru-Vue pressure gauges</h2>
        <p>M/D Totco Tru-Vue gauges offer a large 5-in. fully visible dial with better incrementation for fast, accurate reading of mud pump and stand pipe pressure changes at a glance.</p>
