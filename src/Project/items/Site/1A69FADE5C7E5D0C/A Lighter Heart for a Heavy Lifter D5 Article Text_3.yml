        <p>Allseas commissioned NOV's Fiber Glass Systems to build a maintenance-free ballast system to protect their $2.9 billion/€2.6 billion investment. After intensive review of design specifications, the Bondstrand 2000M pipe series was selected for its corrosion resistance, toughness and temperature performance. With a projected lifespan of five decades or more, the ballast system will last for the life of the vessel and beyond.</p>
        <p>Using detailed pre-design analysis, Fiber Glass Systems produced almost five miles of custom fiberglass pipe of various diameters, along with 11,000 fittings. “Just-in-Time” technology delivered materials to the building site right before installation. This approach prevented exposure damage while the pipe spools were in the shipyard, freeing up precious yard space and eliminating warehouse costs.</p>
