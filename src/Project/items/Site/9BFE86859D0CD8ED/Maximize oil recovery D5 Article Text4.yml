        <p>We hosted Seabox Technology Days event in Stavanger, Norway, to share operational results, not only from NOV, but industry professionals including Rystad Energy, The University of Stavanger, FSubsea, Equinor, Wintershall, and Conoco Phillips. Business cases were presented by the operators that discussed how the SWIT technology can be used to improve concrete examples, building on field development solutions for their portfolio.</p>
        <p>Even more opportunities were discussed during the event, including great advances by The University of Stavanger for smart water applications. It was concluded that Seabox and SWIT are good solutions for their smart water needs.</p>
