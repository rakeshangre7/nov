        <p><strong>How do we address this?</strong> We address this issue by enhancing the performance of existing topside facilities, enabling unmanned water injection, maximizing tie-back value, and reservoir value by providing smart water for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and a significantly reduced carbon footprint.</p>
        <p>Our Seabox™ subsea water treatment technology and SWIT™ ultrafiltration and membrane system are world firsts with their pioneering technology that increase oil recovery. The Seabox module consists of three components: tray, still room, and treatment unit. Both Seabox and SWIT are tested, tried, proven, and provide a solution that meets the needs of the industry.</p>
