        <h2>Fortifying solids control with a small footprint and low weir height.</h2>
        <p>The low weir height of 24 in. (611 mm) enables the Mini Cobra 3-Panel Mud Conditioner to fit on smaller land rigs for which flowline slope is critical. As the name infers, the Mini Cobra 3-Panel Mud Conditioner is a three-panel shaker that has many compatible parts with other Cobra and King Cobra shakers. Common screens, screen support material, and Hammerwedge screen fasteners simplify inventory requirements for contractors with Cobra or King Cobra shakers in their fleet.</p>
        <p>Multiple units can be supplied on a single skid and feature a common feed distribution to reduce installation time and costs and ensure balanced flow to each shaker. The Mini Cobra 3-Panel Mud Conditioner generates 6.5 G’s of efficient linear motion to rapidly remove drilled solids, saving valuable drilling fluid and reducing drilling waste.</p>
        <p>The basket design sets the feed end at 0° and the discharge end at +5°. This basket angle minimizes liquid pool depths, which reduces fluid weight on screens. The basket angle is also adjustable. The flat screening surface evenly distributes fluid across the shaker. All these features maximize usable screen area.</p>
        <p>The popular Cobra shaker family is also available as the Brandt Mini Cobra 3-Panel Mud Conditioner.</p>
