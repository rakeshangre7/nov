        <p><strong>Skid-mounted batch mix unit</strong></p>
        <p>Our skid-mounted batch mix units are designed for offshore and onshore applications in varying configurations.&nbsp;Twin 50-bbl designs (total 100 bbl), single 50-bbl designs, and twin 25-bbl designs (50 bbl total) are standard packages.</p>
        <p>Our twin batch mixers are designed with redundant circulating and discharge centrifugal pumps such that slurry can be mixed in one tank while slurry is discharged from the other.&nbsp;Our design also allows either slurry centrifugal pump to circulate and discharge from either tank, providing backup should one of the pumps ever have an issue.</p>
