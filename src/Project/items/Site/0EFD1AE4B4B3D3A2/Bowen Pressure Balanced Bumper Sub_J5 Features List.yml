        <p>The Bowen&trade; pressure-balanced bumper sub is a long-stroke bumper sub often called a slack joint that&rsquo;s engineered to withstand sustained torque through its full 5-ft stroke under the most severe drilling operations. The sub permits free travel through the full stroke unaffected by variations in pump pressure and/or hydrostatic pressure. The bore through the tool permits full circulation at all times.</p>
        <p>The Bowen pressure-balanced bumper sub is approximately 36 ft long and is available in sizes with minimum outside diameters (ODs) of 4&frac34;, 6&frac14;, and 7&frac34; in. The tool ODs are variable as ordered, and each is manufactured with an OD that matches the drill collar or tool joint OD of the drill string in which it will be used.</p>
        <p>Pressure-balanced bumper subs may be used as motion compensators on floating rigs or to allow controlled feed-off on delicate fishing or milling operations.</p>
