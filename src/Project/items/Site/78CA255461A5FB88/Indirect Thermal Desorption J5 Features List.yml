        <p><strong>Thermal oil recovery (THOR)</strong></p>
        <p>An increase in global awareness of the need for environmental preservation has led the drilling industry to adapt to changes in environmental policies. National environmental laws are now being strictly enforced and companies must adapt their policies to abide by these regulations. The treatment of drill cuttings with thermal desorption provides an excellent option for meeting these standards. NOV has more than 20 years of experience in the thermal treatment of drill cuttings.</p>
