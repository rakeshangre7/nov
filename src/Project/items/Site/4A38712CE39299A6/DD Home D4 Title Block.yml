        <h2 style="color:black;">Important </h2>
        <p>
        It is with great sadness that this year's Derricks and Diamonds Softball Tournament and Gala have been canceled. The safety of our participants, volunteers, and beneficiaries continues to be a priority. National Oilwell Varco and the Derricks and Diamonds team continue to support Snowdrop Foundation and Texas Children's Hospital. Though we will not gather for our traditional events this year, these two organizations will still be celebrated for their continued impact on pediatric cancer patients, survivors, and families.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D2BCF78D11244C958817CC9F3E3FFFC7&amp;_z=z">Snowdrop Foundation Raffle</a>&nbsp;is still set to draw on September 19th, 2020!</strong> Purchase your tickets now to show your direct support to Snowdrop Foundation and have a chance to win a 2020 Polaris Ranger Texas Edition.
        </p>
        <p>On behalf of the Derricks and Diamonds team and NOV, we wish all our supporters good health and safety, and look forward to all the events returning next year!</p>
