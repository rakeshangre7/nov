      Value: "<p>These automated data logging devices operate in the harsh environment of a workshop. Log Master II units may be safely and efficiently operated by one person from the hydraulic console on the Jar Tester Machine or TorqueMaster&trade; units. All functions of the Log Master II logger are easily accessed by using an industrial-grade touchscreen. The Log Master II logger can also be used to log on NOV&rsquo;s Jar Testers. It is available for both stand-alone Jar Testers (model 8090-B-57) and for Jar Testers with a TorqueMaster unit (model 8090-B-514). The Log Master II controller/logger displays and records torque and automatically creates a tool report in PDF that includes connection-specific information and a torque versus time plot. The Log Master II unit features enhanced operator usability with a customizable graphic user interface to match workflows. The supervisory software used with the Log Master II controller/logger takes advantage of an office computer to handle the many functions associated with the creation of tools, job files, and data management of logged jobs.</p>"
