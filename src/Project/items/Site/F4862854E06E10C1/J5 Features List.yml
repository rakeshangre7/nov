        <p>Installed on our own and other manufacturers' equipment worldwide, our boost pumps encompass the reliability of field-proven components together with unique concepts such as the double-lip seal and replaceable sleeve. Together, these features ensure the operator a reliable and user-friendly pump that is easy to maintain in the field without the need for special tools, minimizing downtime and reducing repair costs.<br />
        <br />
        The Hydra Rig&trade; 2LE10002 1.5 &times; 2.5 &times; 6 in. and 2LE10001 2 &times; 3 &times; 6 in. boost pumps are both a centrifugal pump assembly designed specifically to pump liquid nitrogen to boost inlet pressure to supply cryogenic cold ends. The pump is manufactured from HE30 aluminium and stainless steel and uses modified PTFE seals to operate at temperatures down to -320 &deg;F (-196 &deg;C) and pressures up to 150 psi (10 bar). Our cold ends are predominately used in equipment used to provide high-pressure nitrogen gas for oil well servicing.</p>
