        <p>Dualoy&trade; 3000/L piping systems are made of fiberglass-reinforced, aromatic amine cured, rigid, thermosetting epoxy resin. This pipe is manufactured using a unique process by which a continuous cylinder is generated with the fibers oriented more near the circumferential and axial directions than with the reciprocal process. Dualoy 3000/L also includes a pure resin liner.</p>
        <p><strong>Features and benefits</strong></p>
        <p>Fiber Glass Systems is the market leader for underground fuel piping systems, with almost 50 years of continuous supply of UL-listed products. Dualoy 3000L piping is reliable and has never been removed because of fuel incompatibility; thus, there are no reinstall costs. Our products are designed to meet governmental environmental regulations, including those of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>
        <p><strong>Leak Prevention</strong></p>
        <p>UL 971 bonded sump entry fittings provide positive seal at the sump, preventing leaking of underground fuel in or out of the sump. Our Bonded Sump Entry Fitting &ndash; Termination Style also provides Class I protection, which complies with California&rsquo;s requirement for continuous interstitial monitoring of the piping systems&rsquo; secondary containment.</p>
        <p><strong>StationWare 3000</strong></p>
        <p>StationWare 3000 is a stand-alone CAD program that provides a professional-looking station layout drawing and an accurate bill of materials for the site.</p>
