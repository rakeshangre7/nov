In some coiled tubing applications, it may be necessary to seal on various diameters of the bottomhole assembly (BHA). The annular design will seal on an open hole up to 5.50 in. diameter. The hydraulic operating piston of the annular BOP is designed to efficiently actuate the piston, thereby closing the packer and minimizing the effect that well pressure has on the pack-off. The normal 1,500 psi hydraulic pressure is the maximum required for BOP operation over the full 10,000 psi working pressure range.<br />"
