        <p><span style="text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;">Over the last two episodes, you've heard a lot about our Flexibles facilities in Denmark. We talked about our subsea flexible pipe, a manufacturing marvel and example of technical know-how that has to operate flawlessly on the ocean floor for 30 years with only one inspection. We also learned about the critical role metallurgy plays in the process, helping us make pipe that can survive through the challenges of high temperatures, high pressures, and sour service. On the third episode of the series, NOV Today host Michael Gaines sits down with Marie Haar and Adam Rubin to talk in detail about the career journeys that led them here, and what makes our pipe so special.</span></p>
