        <h3>Process automation platform &ndash; NOVOS</h3>
        As the industry&rsquo;s only reflexive drilling system, NOVOS provides control and consistency of rig automation to any operation. By enabling your drillers to automate repetitive drilling activities, the result is consistent performance, with every driller&mdash;regardless of individual experience level&mdash;achieving improved performance time and time again.
        <h3>Integrated drilling systems&nbsp;</h3>
        Our integrated drilling systems Amphion and Cyberbase equip you with the necessary information for increased drilling control over the rig equipment. They merge direct machine control, rig automation, drilling data, CCTV, and third-party information into one coherent system so you can make the right decisions.
        <h3>Machine control systems&nbsp;</h3>
        We use advanced technology to enhance safety and efficiency and reduce redundancy on your rig by providing control systems that automate drill floor processes and equipment interaction. Our machine control systems help prevent power blackouts, mitigate dropped pipe, and avoid tool collisions. We also offer a variety of single-tool interfaces, making our systems flexible enough to accommodate a range of drill floor processes.
        <h3>Control rooms and cabins&nbsp;</h3>
        For over 20 years, we&rsquo;ve provided state-of-the-art control rooms and cabins to the drilling industry, helping our customers provide a safe and efficient work environment. We build on what we know works using our experience and purposeful innovation to meet your needs and expectations on quality, reliability, and lifecycle costs of your equipment.&nbsp;
