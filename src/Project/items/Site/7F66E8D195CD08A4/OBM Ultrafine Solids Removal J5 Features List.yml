      Hint: description
      Value: |
        <p>As oil-based muds are reused from well to well, a buildup of ultra-fine low-gravity solids occurs in drilling fluid systems. This buildup causes an increase in mud viscosity, which can lead to reduced rate of penetration (ROP) and solids removal efficiency. Petro-Claim&trade; recovers base oil from spent oil-based mud on-site for reuse in the mud system.</p>
        <p>Petro-Claim uses electrokinetics to effectively separate the ultrafine drilled solids out of oil-based mud (OBM) and recover valuable base oil. Using proprietary coated electrodes, Petro-Claim applies a low-power electrical field to the OBM, destabilizing the molecular bonds between the solids and the oil. Through the destabilization process, the solids and water settle out as a result of gravity, and Petro-Claim automatically recovers the oil. The result is a clear and clean base oil&mdash;free of solids and water&mdash;resulting in significant savings in mud dilution and waste disposal costs.</p>
        <p>Petro-Claim is a proven, cost effective on-site approach to removing colloidal and ultrafine LGS of less than 6 microns (too fine for removal by traditional solids control equipment). No other treatment works as efficiently or as effectively, and&mdash;unlike competitors&rsquo; systems that use heat or chemical approaches&mdash;Petro-Claim doesn&rsquo;t dilute the fluid or alter the original properties of the base oil, which means once it leaves the Petro-Claim, it&rsquo;s ready for reuse.</p>
        <p>Petro-Claim is installed on a compact, rugged, portable DNV 2.71 skid designed for easy setup. The Class I Div. 1 Petro-Claim is suitable for use on land and offshore. It uses no consumables and requires less than 100 kW of electricity to operate.</p>
        <h3 class="J5-features-list__headline">Uses</h3>
