        <p>The Grant Prideco Double Shoulder (GPDS) connection is a high-performance rotary-shouldered tool joint connection available for drill pipe ranging in size from 2⅜ to 6⅝ in. GPDS offers a versatile alternative to standard API connection designs when higher operational torque and tool joint wear allowance are desired, and it is fully interchangeable with corresponding API NC or FH counterparts. GPDS is a proven connection that provides increased torsional capacity, promotes more streamlined configurations, and tolerates more tool joint wear than standard API rotary-shouldered connections.</p>
        <h2>Improved torque capacity</h2>
        <p>Streamlined GPDS connections provide 20 to 50% more torque than API rotary-shouldered connections of the same dimensions. This additional strength provides the required torque for drilling to extended depths or in more demanding environments.</p>
        <h2>Extended wear allowance</h2>
        <p>The GPDS connection greatly extends the life of the joint by tolerating more OD wear because of its increased torsional capacity.</p>
        <h2>Interchangeability</h2>
        <p>Although similar to other API connections, GPDS incorporates an internal secondary torque shoulder. GPDS has the same thread form and is interchangeable with its API counterpart connection, as shown in the chart in the specifications tab. The GPDS pin secondary torque shoulder runs out without shouldering in the back of the API box connection. Similarly, the API pin will make up to the GPDS box. &ldquo;Interchangeability&rdquo; means that the connections will mate together, make up, and function; however, the performance properties will be limited to those of an API connection.</p>
        <h2>Slim profile and improved hydraulics</h2>
        <p>The GPDS connection&rsquo;s increased torsional strength enables tool joint dimensional optimization more suitable for the pipe body torsional strength. GPDS connections can be configured with a smaller OD and larger ID compared to standard API connections, contributing to improved hydraulic performance. The GPDS design also provides a true flush ID through the mated tool joint assembly. There is no gap or change in the ID from the box to the pin, creating a smoother fluid flow with less turbulence and eliminating the opportunity for trapped cement and cuttings.</p>
        <h2>uGPDS</h2>
        <p>uGPDS&trade; is an enhanced version of the GPDS connection that enables either higher torque capacity or further enhanced hydraulics. uGPDS connections are interchangeable with GPDS and API connections of similar size. Contact your Grant Prideco representative about our uLtimate&trade; Series connections for more detailed information.</p>
