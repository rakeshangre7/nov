        <p>The PowerPLUS&trade; CT power section delivers more rotational power and torque than conventional coiled tubing power sections. PowerPLUS power sections use a high-performance elastomer that delivers 50% more rotational power and torque than traditional power sections.</p>
        <p>The elastomer performs remarkably in both water-based fluids and nitrogen, which makes this power section ideal for CT milling operations. Selection of new NOV power sections will provide high-performance CT operations and reduce your milling and drilling time.</p>
        <li>Extensive research and analysis by NOV on the design and manufacture this impressive addition to our fleet of power sections included the following: Elastomer formulation testing</li>
        <li>Fluid immersion testing</li>
