        <p>To support clients with flexible pipes in operation and to assist in the development of fields, Flexibles&rsquo; System Assessment Services (SAS) department delivers high-quality consultancy services that support the integrity management of flexible pipes.</p>
        <p>When we supply a pipe design, it is always for a specified design lifetime, and, when used within the design parameters, our pipes have never failed. Part of the reason for that is the robust estimates and assumptions we make during the design phase. This leaves a margin that we can investigate with a lifetime extension assessment, allowing operators to continue using our equipment with complete peace of mind.</p>
