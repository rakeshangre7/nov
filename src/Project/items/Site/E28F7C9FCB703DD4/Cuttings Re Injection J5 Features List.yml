        <p>Throughout the drilling industry, there is a growing emphasis on reducing drilling wastes, especially from oil-based mud (OBM) cuttings. Many drilling areas are rapidly moving toward "zero discharge" or "total containment" operations. Cuttings re-injection is an environmentally sound, cost-effective method of zero discharge or total containment drilling waste disposal.</p>
        <p>WellSite Services' FluidControl group is the leading provider of cuttings re-injection services to the drilling industry. The technique of injecting drilling waste into a casing annulus has been used in the industry since 1986. Cuttings re-injection has since been used in other oilfield applications, such as production pit closure. This technique for the disposal of oilfield waste and drilled cuttings results in a zero discharge to the environment. It is the only field-proven, environmentally sound, cost-effective method for disposing of drilling waste and drilled cuttings at the rig site.</p>
        <p><strong>The system</strong></p>
        <p>The BRANDT&trade; CRI system is designed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Process cuttings at rates as high as 50 t/hr, depending on the composition of the cuttings</li>
            <li>Achieve injection rates as high as 15 bbl/min (4 to 6 bbl/min is customary)</li>
            <li>Achieve injection pressures up to 10,000 psi with adequate well design (typical injection surface injection pressures range from 500 to 2,500 psi)</li>
            <li>Process large cuttings produced by fast drilling operations</li>
            <li>Process fines generated by slow drilling with polycrystalline diamond compact bits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Customized units with many control options are available to meet unique process needs and space requirements. All systems are designed to provide reliable and simple operations with uncomplicated maintenance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Main components</strong></p>
        <p>All FluidControl cuttings injection projects consist of three main components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cuttings transfer system</li>
            <li>Slurrification unit</li>
            <li>High-pressure injection pump</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Optional equipment</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Slurry holding tank</li>
            <li>Sizing shaker</li>
            <li>Grinding mill</li>
        </ul>
