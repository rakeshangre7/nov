        <p>Our SlimSplit&trade; C aluminum wireline winch system can switch between every imaginable well servicing activity, saving you time and money by eliminating the need for another winch, operator, or engineer on the rig.</p>

The system features a comfortable, enclosed cabin with purge and pressurization systems for the safe operation of your logging system. Full ATEX and CE marking with DNV 2.7-1 lift-ing certification completes the package.
        </p>
        <p>Highly compact and versatile, our self-contained wireline winch system can be configured with optional single-drum winches to perform braided-line logging or slickline operations. The standard configuration comprises a powerful diesel-driven power pack, comfortable ergonomic operator cabin, and your choice of winches.
        </p>
        <p>Compact, comfortable, lightweight, and adaptable&mdash;the SlimSplit system helps you get the job done with quality and reliability supplied as standard.
