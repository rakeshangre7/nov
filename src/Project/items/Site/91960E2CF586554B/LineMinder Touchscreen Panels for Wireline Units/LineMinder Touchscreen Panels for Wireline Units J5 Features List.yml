        <p>LineMinder products are state-of-the-art, rugged, high-brightness, capacitive touch-panel screens. They are available in either 7- or 10-in. versions for ATEX Zone 2 areas (with USB connections for data export) or in 10 in. for safe area operations. The ATEX versions are rated for operation from -4 to 122 &deg;F (-20 to 50 &deg;C) and can be stored between -40 and 140 &deg;F (-40 and 60 &deg;C).</p>
        <p>The LineMinder Slickline provides depth, speed, and tension, with a safety shutdown function on tension. The LineMinder Logging also features a full-screen trend display and safety action functions triggered by differential tension limits. Optionally, the LineMinder Logging version can be extended with serial or Ethernet data forwarding and a configurable well-pressure display. The LineMinder Winch Control offers all the features of the LineMinder Logging with the addition of constant speed control, thus enabling smooth logging operations.</p>
