        Most of the easy oil has already been discovered, and wellsites are increasingly difficult to access. Our new ultra-high-capacity CTU is designed to make it easier to access these wellsites while carrying enough pipe to do the job.<br />
        <br />
        Our new, innovative CTU design allows for the maneuverability of a chassis-mounted CTU with the payload capacity of a large, multi-axle trailer. The UHC CTU is available in multiple configurations and can use trucks and tractors from any major truck chassis manufacturer. By listening to you, our new UHC CTU addresses all the key concerns that arise with existing coiled tubing units, including maneuverability, lack of ground clearance, spacious control cabins, and reliability.<br />
        <br />
        Our newly designed ultra-high-capacity coiled tubing unit consists of three components: a control and power unit (CPU), reel trailer, and a transport stand (injector and PCE).<br />
        <br />
        <strong>CPU</strong><br />
        <br />
        The control and power unit truck is the heart of this design. It consists of our proven hydraulic wet kit that is driven off a full horsepower PTO, powered hose reels with wet center connections for the blowout preventer (BOP), and injector power and control lines. We use new technology, including proven touchscreen technology, electric over hydraulic controls, and magnetic filtration.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Reel trailer</strong><br />
        <br />
        The reel trailer is designed to be less than 14 ft 9 in. (4.5 m) high and only 8.5 ft (2.6 m) wide, with a low center of gravity for safety and high approach and departure angles for traveling through rough terrain. It also has a lift mechanism that increases the ground clearance to over 21 in. (.54 mm) for use on rough and/or difficult terrain.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Transport stand<br />
        </strong><br />
        The transport skid consists of two skids connected together for easy handling. They can be quickly separated at the wellsite for ideal positioning and easy rig-up. Our HR&minus;6100 coiled tubing injector is the most popular injector used on shale fracturing well operations and is designed for 100,000 lb maximum pull and 50,000 lb snubbing capacity.<br />
        <br />
        Our Texas Oil Tools&trade; (TOT) ES model BOP is a lightweight, high-pressure coiled tubing BOP that features hydraulic-assisted ram change and balanced shear actuators. This model is available in 4.06-in. and 5.12-in. sizes and 10K or 15K psi pressure ratings.

        <p>Most of the easy oil has already been discovered, and wellsites are increasingly difficult to access. Our new ultra-high-capacity CTU is designed to make it easier to access these wellsites while carrying enough pipe to do the job.</p>
        <p>Our new, innovative CTU design allows for the maneuverability of a chassis-mounted CTU with the payload capacity of a large, multi-axle trailer. The UHC CTU is available in multiple configurations and can use trucks and tractors from any major truck chassis manufacturer. By listening to you, our new UHC CTU addresses all the key concerns that arise with existing coiled tubing units, including maneuverability, lack of ground clearance, spacious control cabins, and reliability.</p>
        <p>Our newly designed ultra-high-capacity coiled tubing unit consists of three components: a control and power unit (CPU), reel trailer, and a transport stand (injector and PCE).</p>
        <h2>CPU</h2>
        <p>The control and power unit truck is the heart of this design. It consists of our proven hydraulic wet kit that is driven off a full horsepower PTO, powered hose reels with wet center connections for the blowout preventer (BOP), and injector power and control lines. We use new technology, including proven touchscreen technology, electric over hydraulic controls, and magnetic filtration.</p>
        <h2>Reel trailer</h2>
        <p>The reel trailer is designed to be less than 14 ft 9 in. (4.5 m) high and only 8.5 ft (2.6 m) wide, with a low center of gravity for safety and high approach and departure angles for traveling through rough terrain. It also has a lift mechanism that increases the ground clearance to over 21 in. (.54 mm) for use on rough and/or difficult terrain.</p>
        <h2>Transport stand</h2>
        <p>The transport skid consists of two skids connected together for easy handling. They can be quickly separated at the wellsite for ideal positioning and easy rig-up. Our HR&minus;6100 coiled tubing injector is the most popular injector used on shale fracturing well operations and is designed for 100,000 lb maximum pull and 50,000 lb snubbing capacity.</p>
        <p>Our Texas Oil Tools&trade; (TOT) ES model BOP is a lightweight, high-pressure coiled tubing BOP that features hydraulic-assisted ram change and balanced shear actuators. This model is available in 4.06-in. and 5.12-in. sizes and 10K or 15K psi pressure ratings.</p>
