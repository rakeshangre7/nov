        <p><strong>Masts</strong> &ndash; We offer a full range of services from preventative maintenance agreements to complete refurbishment and recertification of masts. These services can be performed in our facility or on our customers&rsquo; premises.</p>
        <p><strong>Trucks and winches </strong>&ndash; Historically, truck and winch maintenance was largely performed by the service provider; however, in recent years more and more companies are returning their equipment to the original manufacturer either for maintenance or for rework to current standards, potentially gaining several years of additional working life. These services can be available on an ad-hoc basis&mdash;performed either in our facility or on the customer&rsquo;s premises. However, a growing number of customers are committing to long-term maintenance contracts, with dedicated work slots allocated for maintenance and rework. These agreements can be individually tailored to suit our customers&rsquo; requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Wire, cable, and spooling</strong> &ndash; We offer wire sales and spooling services from our UK location. Various sizes and grades of slickline and braided cables are held in stock and can be spooled to the customer or to Elmar-designed drums as required. In addition, spooling services offer the client the ability to valet their wire before and after operations, providing an independent report on the wire condition.</p>
        <p><strong>WPCE </strong>&ndash; When working with pressure control equipment, ensuring it is operating safely at all times is a primary concern in the industry. It is accepted that the OEM is the preferred option for carrying out servicing and recertification of this safety-critical equipment due to their knowledge, expertise, and use of original parts. Our continued effort is on ensuring customer requirements are met for 5-year recertifications by offering flexible solutions based around budgets and locations.</p>
