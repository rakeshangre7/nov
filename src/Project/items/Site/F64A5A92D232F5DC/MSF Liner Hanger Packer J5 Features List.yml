            <li>Large bore and ability to tie back eliminates the need for a second production packer as liner isolation.</li>
            <li>Rotation ability ensures that the completion can be landed every time without problem.</li>
            <li>Hydraulic setting tool allows shallow setting depths without concern about adequate element pack-off force.</li>
            <li>Full-bore design allows passage of any balls or darts for cementing or stimulation.</li>

      Hint: description
      Value: "<p>Our MSF liner top packer is designed specifically for the challenges of horizontal hydraulic multistage fracturing completions. The slips, designed with nearly fully circumferential contact with the casing, ensure that the system performs under stimulation pressures even in high-yield grades of casing. In addition, a one-piece sealing element helps to avoid swabbing and enables the higher circulation rates required to maintain hole cleanliness during deployment of the liner.</p>"
