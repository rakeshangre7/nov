        <p>NOV Cellar Tech manufactures custom fracturing support and truck manifolds for use during completions. Manufactured to the highest industry standards, they are customizable to meet the needs of our customers.</p>
        <p>Designed to contain spills, the manifolds unload water for frac jobs in a controlled environment; the containment skids can be drained to the impoundment for proper fluid disposal. Our frac support and truck manifolds are hot-dipped galvanized, helping resist corrosion for many years. Our custom truck unloading manifolds have a capacity for five simultaneous trucks, are self-contained, and transport as a single load with the corresponding containment skid. The frac support manifolds have 100-bpm capacity and are skid-mounted for easy transport. Both manifolds are reversible&mdash;left or right hand.</p>
