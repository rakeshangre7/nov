        <p>Our team supported the client from the concept phase of the project, providing solution-oriented designs that fit into the available space in the existing topside. We helped manage a very challenging overall project schedule, with nine process modules completed in 15 months.</p>
        
        <p>The FPSO Helang redeployment has been NOV's first full topside process systems delivery (separation, gas, and water treatment) and the first project with an integrated execution model, with engineering, procurement, and construction all done in-house. This not only minimized interfaces but helped deliver a fast-track project in a tight time schedule.</p>
        
        <p>The project encompasses redeployment of the existing FPSO Four Rainbow—now named FPSO Helang—that will operate in Block SK10 offshore Sarawak, East Malaysia. NOV delivered topside modules for this FPSO in 2003 and further upgraded it with an additional module in 2009. The basis of design for the new fields (Helang and Layang) required significant modifications in the process systems.</p>
