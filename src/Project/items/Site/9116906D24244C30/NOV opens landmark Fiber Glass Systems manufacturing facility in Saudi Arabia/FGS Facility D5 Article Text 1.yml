        <p> With 22 000 m&sup2; of manufacturing space, this facility will be the first local manufacturer of spoolable and jointed GRE pipe, GRE high-pressure line pipe, and downhole tubing and casing. Bringing composite solutions from our Fiberspar&trade; and STAR&trade; product lines to the Kingdom will allow us to help our customers eliminate corrosion in their applications, reduce installation and maintenance costs over their pipe's lifecycle, and more cost-effectively transport higher quality resources to the market. Saudi leadership has consistently sought out improvements that will drive higher levels of efficiency, safety, and environmental stewardship, and modern, composite materials represent the latest advancements in that journey. We're excited for the future and proud of this landmark development, which will drive the proliferation of these solutions into other Middle East markets while improving the lives of people in this region and around the world.&nbsp;</p>
