      Value: "<p>The deepwater and ultradeepwater sectors remain critically important to future oil and gas development but also economically challenged in the current market environment. OCTG completion workover risers (CWORs) have been cited as an alternative to drill pipe-based CWORs due to the inherent challenges of designing drill pipe connections that can withstand the harsh service conditions of deeper, higher-pressure prospects. Though their upfront cost is less expensive than drill pipe-based CWORs, their total cost of ownership is significantly higher. Fortunately, drill pipe-based CWORs have advanced technologically and are now a viable, cost-effective solution in even the most challenging completion and intervention operations.</p>"
