        <p>Our Horizontal Surface Pumping System (HPS ) is designed with a focus on extended operational life, reduced maintenance and equipment costs, and flexible, easy deployment in ever-changing site conditions. The HPS is available with pre-wired instrumentation and the NOV Guardian VFD option allowing customers to be prepared for varying operating conditions.</p>
        <h3>Seal system</h3>
        <p>Our HPS features an API 610-compliant seal system that can be replaced in as little as 15 minutes, using a process that does not disturb the motor and piping connections and requires minimal or no realignment.</p>
        <h3>Thrust chamber</h3>
        <p>Leveraging decades of experience from the proven <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8966F9A54DC24336BE016460C8B487FB&amp;_z=z">MISSION™ Magnum™</a>&nbsp;centrifugal pump, our field-serviceable HPS thrust chamber is assembled with top-brand, angular contact bearings. Additionally, the L10 life rating matches API 610 standards of 25,000 hours up to 20,000 lbf of thrust.</p>
        <h3>Skid</h3>
        <p>Providing site flexibility and reduced lead times, our HPS skid system features a rigid steel frame and modular components, which were designed using the latest 3D modeling software and Finite Element Analysis to resist motor torsion and limit vibration to extend pump life.</p>
