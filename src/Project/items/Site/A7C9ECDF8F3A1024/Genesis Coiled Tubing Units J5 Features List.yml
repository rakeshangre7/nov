        <h2>You have a new normal. So do we.</h2>
        <p>Our Genesis&trade; line of high-capacity coiled tubing units (CTUs) was created to support our vision of building quality, fit-for-purpose products in a timely fashion while upholding the highest safety standards. Featuring high-visibility cabins, HMI displays, electric over hydraulic controls, and industry-leading injector technology, Genesis CTUs are the future of coiled tubing.</p>
        <h2>ST2438 Coiled Tubing Unit</h2>
        <p>The Genesis ST2438 four-axle CTU is optimized to maximize your tubing payload, and it legally carries up to 24,000 ft of 2⅜-in. coiled tubing with a dry tubing tare of 110,000 lb. This coiled tubing unit model is permittable in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, and Wyoming.</p>
        <h2>ST2438 Liberty Coiled Tubing Unit</h2>
        <p>With 24,000 ft of 2⅜-in. coiled tubing capacity, the ST2438 Liberty CTU ensures you can quickly and safely get to your operations&mdash;even if it involves crossing both sides of the 49th parallel. With just a quick switch of the axle/suspension group, it is completely feasible to complete a service job in Central Alberta on Monday and be rigged up on a pad in North Dakota on Tuesday evening.</p>
        <p>This versatile unit helps reduce the need to buy separate region-specific equipment, saving you both time and money. When market conditions deteriorate in a given area or perhaps a trip south of the border is overdue after a long, hard Canadian winter, the Genesis Liberty CTU is ready to relocate at a moment's notice.</p>
