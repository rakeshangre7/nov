        <p>24,000 ft of 2⅜-in. coiled tubing capacity.<br />
        <br />
        The newest coiled tubing unit in our Genesis line, the ST2438 Liberty, ensures you can quickly and safely get to your operation&mdash;even if it involves crossing both sides of the 49th parallel. With just a quick switch of the axle/suspension group, it is completely feasible to complete a service job in Central Alberta on Monday and be rigged up on a pad in North Dakota on Tuesday evening.<br />
        <br />
        This versatile unit helps reduce the need to buy separate region-specific equipment&mdash;saving our customers time and money. When market conditions deteriorate in a given area or perhaps a trip south of the border is overdue after a long, hard Canadian winter, the Genesis Liberty is ready to relocate at a moment's notice. Meet Genesis.<br />

        <p>24,000 ft of 2⅜-in. coiled tubing capacity.<br />
        <br />
        The newest coiled tubing unit in our Genesis line, the ST2438 Liberty, ensures you can quickly and safely get to your operation&mdash;even if it involves crossing both sides of the 49th parallel. With just a quick switch of the axle/suspension group, it is completely feasible to complete a service job in Central Alberta on Monday and be rigged up on a pad in North Dakota on Tuesday evening.<br />
        <br />
        This versatile unit helps reduce the need to buy separate region-specific equipment&mdash;saving our customers time and money. When market conditions deteriorate in a given area or perhaps a trip south of the border is overdue after a long, hard Canadian winter, the Genesis Liberty is ready to relocate at a moment's notice. Meet Genesis.<br />

        <p><strong>You</strong><b> have a new normal. So do we.</b><br />
        <br />
        Genesis was created to support our vision of building quality, fit-for-purpose products in a timely fashion while upholding the highest safety standards. Featuring high-visibility cabins, HMI displays, electric over hydraulic controls, and industry-leading injector technology, Genesis is the future of coiled tubing.</p>
        <p>24,000 ft of 2⅜-in. coiled tubing capacity.<br />
        <br />
        The newest coiled tubing unit in our Genesis line, the ST2438 Liberty, ensures you can quickly and safely get to your operation—even if it involves crossing both sides of the 49th parallel. With just a quick switch of the axle/suspension group, it is completely feasible to complete a service job in Central Alberta on Monday and be rigged up on a pad in North Dakota on Tuesday evening.<br />
        <br />
        This versatile unit helps reduce the need to buy separate region-specific equipment—saving our customers time and money. When market conditions deteriorate in a given area or perhaps a trip south of the border is overdue after a long, hard Canadian winter, the Genesis Liberty is ready to relocate at a moment's notice. Meet Genesis.</p>
