        <p>i-Trace CEM&trade; is the result of a cooperation between NOV and RESMAN. Wireless reservoir surveillance technology is used to obtain reservoir data over time without risky interventions or costly modifications to the completion hardware.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The simple design consists of a protective carrier that is made up as part of the completion string, strategically spaced across the zone of interest and activated by proven ball-drop technology. When contacted by the target fluid (oil or water) and exposed to flow, the Resman Intelligent Tracers&reg; are designed to mark production with a unique chemical signature. The unique chemical signature from each downhole location flows to the surface, where production fluid samples are collected and analyzed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A wide selection of Intelligent Tracers is available to customize and match various well conditions such as downhole fluids, temperature, and monitoring objectives. The i-Trace CEM is compatible with cemented liner completions using plug and perf or with our i-Frac&trade; cemented sleeve system. For plug-and-perf completions, one ball size accommodates all carriers. In cemented completions with i-Frac CEM, a specific ball size is required for each corresponding stage.</p>
