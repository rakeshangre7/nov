        <p>With decades of field-based experience and an elite team of experts, we provide complete separation, dehydration, and desalting solutions for crude oil. We can design and supply a full range of separator and scrubber internals, deoiling hydrocyclones, electrostatic coalescers, compact oil treaters, and heavy-oil processing systems. Our services include consultancy, testing, and qualification.</p>
        <p>We use standardized components to come up with a customized design for all our products, carefully balancing parameters such as cost, performance, size, and weight to maximize the performance value for our clients in diverse operational conditions. Our products are based on 40 years of experience and are continuously improved based on feedback from brownfield retrofit projects.</p>
        <p>Our offerings include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Separators with internals</li>
            <li>Scrubbers with internals</li>
            <li>Vertical/horizontal flow electrostatic dehydrator</li>
            <li>Electrostatic desalter systems</li>
            <li>Compact Electrostatic Coalescer (CEC™)</li>
            <li>Compact wellhead separators and scrubbers</li>
            <li>Slug catchers/knockout drums</li>
            <li>Free-water knockout drums</li>
            <li>Heater treaters</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to consultancy, commissioning, start-up, and operational support, we provide full aftermarket services for our installed equipment, including maintenance, optimization, spare-parts management, and operator training. Our offering is a true start-to-finish service in which every element reflects our superior expertise and commitment to perform.</p>
        <p>We release maximum value—at minimum cost to our operators—from these products and services.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Crude oil treatment</h2>
        <p>Cost-saving plant layouts and performance are enabled by our unique use of proven, compact technologies to minimize platform deck requirements in multiple process packages.</p>
        <h3>Compact Electrostatic Coalescer</h3>
        <p>The patented CEC technology is a small, lightweight flow-through system that increases the size of water droplets dispersed in petroleum oil, greatly enhancing the separation performance in a downstream gravity separator.</p>
        <p>By innovatively splitting the coalescence and the separation process, the CEC is made very compact and can be simply applied upstream of new or existing separators, electrostatic vessel dehydrators, and storage tanks. The CEC is powered by our patented Magtech™ controllable transformer technology, a unique power supply with no active components, meeting the most challenging industry requirements for safety and robustness.</p>
        <h3>Horizontal flow electrostatic treater</h3>
        <p>Our patented horizontal flow electrostatic treater uniquely provides separation of gas, hydrocarbons, and water. As a separate upstream degasser is not required, the unit can be placed tightly on same deck as the upstream separator or dehydrator, enabling more flexibility in plant design.</p>
        <h2>Heavy oil treatment</h2>
        <p>We offer unmatched know-how and specialized products to cost-efficiently handle viscous production fluids and address harsh operating conditions. Full technologies and consultancy are provided for applications including oil sand and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) fields.</p>
        <p>Our technologies include free-water knockouts, mechanical treaters, heater treaters, slop- oil treaters, and electrostatic dehydrators and desalters. We also include full strategies and technologies for handling rag, slop, and waste water.&nbsp;</p>
