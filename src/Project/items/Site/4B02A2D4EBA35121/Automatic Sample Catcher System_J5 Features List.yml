        <p>Our system consists of the sample catcher mounted to the piping and a controller that can be remotely mounted, such as in a control room. The easy-to-use electronic controller allows the operator to take a single sample or start and stop the sampler with preset timing modes for small, medium, and large blends.<br />
        <br />
        The sample catcher contains a fixed, replaceable probe that collects material as it passes and a valve that opens to allow the material to pass into a sample chamber. The valve closes and traps the collected sample in the chamber. Once the controller receives a confirmed closed signal, a second valve opens to allow the sample to gently fall into a bag or bucket. The controller ensures that both valves cannot open at the same time, preventing the possibility of blowing pressurized material into the environment or around any personnel.</p>
