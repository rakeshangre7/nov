        <p>Several clients in the region determined that a water management solution was necessary to address these issues, and specifically requested a technology that receives fluids directly from the wellhead via headers and processes them in a very compact manner to prepare oil for export. Most of the product received by their production units&mdash;giant facilities that have capacities of more than 200,000 bbl of liquid per day&mdash;is an emulsion, meaning that the liquid/liquid separation cannot be achieved using exclusively enhanced gravity separators. The typical solution for breaking the emulsions, the application of heat, is often not feasible for this application due to various cost and footprint restraints; furthermore, such heating systems could often be complicated and difficult to operate.</p>
        <p>NOV developed a unique Compact Electrostatic Coalescer (CEC&trade;) technology unit that meets the demands of operators facing tight emulsion productions. The CEC applies electrostatic fields to the emulsion, causing the water droplets to vibrate, shake, and collide with other water droplets. This allows the water to separate out from oil and other elements and eliminates the need for costly, hard-to-use heating systems. The fabrication phase for these projects have already begun, with NOV to supply the CEC as well as all the other required separation vessels and internals and several other proprietary technologies to achieve the overall process guarantees as part of an overall Oil and Water Treatment Scheme in the first quarter of 2018. NOV will continue to be present from late 2018 onward for commissioning and start-up, operating jointly with the operators to ensure that the projects run at optimum efficiency at that the equipment consistently works as expected.</p>
