      Value: "<p>Traditionally, only MWD drilling tools have given operators knowledge of what is happening downhole, with no option for a similar tool for completion-liner deployment. The i-Con&trade; string-dynamics logging tool addresses this need, providing data from deployment of lower completions and liner-hanger assemblies to give insight into what is happening in the well. The tool records tension, compression, torque, temperature, and internal and external pressure. Once retrieved from the hole, data obtained by the i-Con tool can be easily downloaded and investigated to improve understanding of downhole and surface measurements. In addition, the tool has a full bore ID, enabling compatibility with liner-hanger systems to allow cementing plugs to pass.</p>"
