      Value: <p>The data obtained was used to facilitate the optimization and continuous improvement of liner deployment operations to allow the drilling and completion team to overcome a steep learning curve. The operator was also able to establish best practices and troubleshoot unexpected issues more effectively because of the data. By focusing on achieving planned total depth (TD) with the lower completion liner and developing an active learning strategy to optimize deployment throughout the campaign, the logging tool made it possible to successfully overcome past challenges and achieve planned TD in most wells.</p>
