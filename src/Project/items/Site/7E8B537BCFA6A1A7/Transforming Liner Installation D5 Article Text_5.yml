        <p>Over the 11-well program, the operator was able to reach a success rate of 98.9% for planned completion-liner TD, an increase of more than 36% over previous campaigns. The accurate downhole data obtained allowed the operator to improve their operations, prevent failures, and reduce nonproductive time (NPT). NPT saw particularly substantial reductions in the second half of the wells, which were delivered efficiently despite being the most technically challenging wells of the campaign. Continual improvements in design and operational parameters further contributed to this success and helped the operator develop lessons learned for implementation in future campaigns.</p>
        <p>Understanding downhole dynamics presents a wide range of benefits to oil and gas operators. This project allowed NOV to demonstrate that optimization of operations, even in challenging applications, is possible with innovative equipment and the expertise to properly implement a solution.</p>
