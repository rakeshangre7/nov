        <p>The PRIME service&rsquo;s comprehensive inspection has proven effective for numerous customers in the field, contributing to potential months of time savings. During one inspection, NOV found cracks in a customer&rsquo;s equipment that could have caused significant failure and potential safety hazards. A thorough shaker inspection enabled identification of the issue and allowed the customer to save several weeks of potential downtime that could have otherwise halted or slowed down drilling operations or, even worse, led to an HSE shutdown.</p>
        <p>Drilling contractors need to be able to turn scheduled downtime into a window of opportunity, and the PRIME service does just that. Personnel are freed to work on the rig components they know best, while NOV uses the allotted timeframe to concentrate on extending and optimizing the operational life of solids control and drilling waste management systems. PRIME inspection can take a rig from stacked to contract-ready, representing an evolution in true inspection services: settling for &ldquo;just good enough&rdquo; is no longer necessary.</p>
