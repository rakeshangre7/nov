      Hint: description
      Value: |
        <p>A robust tool for gathering and understanding dynamic data recorded during well operations, the i-Con&trade; Real Time (RT) is a compact, real-time monitoring sub equipped with an electronics package consisting of sensors, batteries, and wired connection for use in drill pipe-conveyed operations. Traditionally, the gathering of precise mechanical downhole dynamic data has been limited to the use of measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools during drilling operations. However, in most well operations in the completion and intervention phase, the same downhole data would provide valuable input for operational verification, planning, and diagnostics.</p>
        <p>The i-Con RT has wired drill pipe connections to ensure seamless integration with the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F16E12E517A3406EBFEAC4456826C962&amp;_z=z">IntelliServ&trade; wired drill pipe</a>&nbsp;and a full-bore inside diameter (ID) to allow for most work string setups. The intelligent sub records tension, compression, torque, temperature, pressure, vibrations, and acceleration where it matters&mdash;downhole. Most importantly, the wired drill pipe connection allows the i-Con RT to deliver the information when it counts&mdash;on the rig and in seconds. The IntelliServ wired drill pipe can convey the information in seconds and functions independently of tripping speed, pressure, or circulating speed. Downhole data can be reviewed in real time and compared with surface measurements. This provides improved understanding and learning and ensures optimal decision-making, allowing for reduced NPT without waiting to retrieve the data.</p>
