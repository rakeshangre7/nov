        <p>With our heated pipe technology, you can stop worrying about wax and hydrate issues in your operations.</p>
        <p>With a novel method for heating flexible pipes, we help you restart your production whenever you need by eliminating the critical cooldown window found in traditional, costly, time-sensitive, and potentially ineffective mitigation techniques. Just as importantly, our heated pipe has a compact footprint compared to other heating technologies.</p>
        <p>Heated pipe uses the properties of a standard flexible pipe, which brings a range of benefits to any operation. The technology is factory acceptance tested and fully integrated yet completely stand-alone. The result is significantly lower as-installed, lifetime, and operational costs compared to competing technologies.&nbsp;The system is effectively operated as a coaxial cable, where electrical current is passed through the carcass and returned via the tensile armor layers.</p>
