        <p>The TUNDRA Offshore Mud Cooler provides effective control of drilling fluid temperatures, considerably reducing the risks involved in such operations. </p>
        <p>It lowers operating costs by helping to extend elastomer service life and improves drilling mud conditions while making it possible to decrease additives by stabilizing the rheological properties of the drilling fluid. Drilling efficiency is also increased using mud coolers, resulting in greater endurance and accuracy for in-hole measuring devices and enabling such tools to operate at greater depths. Lower drilling fluid temperatures result in fewer health and injury risks to rig personnel.</p>
        <p>TUNDRA Offshore Mud Cooler Design</p>
        <p>The TUNDRA Offshore Mud Cooler incorporates single or dual high-quality plate heat exchangers designed to ASME pressure vessel standards. These heat exchangers can be operated independently with a single parallel system or in series with a dual-pack modular system with communal flow manifold.</p>
        <p>Plate heat exchanger technology (predominantly used in offshore applications) is used by running seawater and mud through adjacent plates that are connected and sealed to contain individually. Both fluids are controlled through a self-contained mud/water manifold.</p>
