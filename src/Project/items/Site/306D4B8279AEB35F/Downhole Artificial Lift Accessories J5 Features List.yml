        <h2>NHA hydraulic tubing anchor</h2>
        <p>The NHA hydraulic tubing anchor is a hydraulically set, retrievable anchor catcher designed to hold the tubing string in compression or tension. The NHA does not require tubing manipulation to set or retrieve. To set, pressure is applied to a temporary plug below the anchor. After setting, bidirectional slips anchor the tubing to prevent tubing movement during rod pumping and to prevent the tubing from falling should the tubing part.</p>
        <p>The compact design is ideally suited for doglegs and highly deviated wells. The anchor is available in both wicker and carbide slip configurations. The NHA is released by straight-pull to shear releasing pins.</p>
        <h3 class="J5-features-list__headline">Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hydraulically set</li>
            <li>Adjustable straight-pull shear release</li>
            <li>Short overall length suitable for highly deviated wells</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>NQT quarter-turn tubing anchor</h2>
        <p>The NQT quarter-turn tubing anchor features quarter-turn set and release with the same robust slip system featured on the NASI-X packer. The anchor may be landed in tension, compression, or neutral position. The anchor includes an adjustable safety straight-pull shear release. Its special cone design maintains slip engagement through load reciprocation, preventing the anchor from working while loose.</p>
        <p>The compact design is ideally suited for doglegs and highly deviated wells. The anchor is available in both wicker and carbide slip configurations. Additional sizes are available upon request.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>NAC-1 tubing anchor catcher</h2>
        <p>The NAC-1 tubing anchor catcher is a rotationally activated tool used to prevent vertical movement of the tubing. The drag block design provides better torque resistance than an older drag spring design. When installed with the proper amount of tension, this anchor prevents tubing movement during rod pump operations.</p>
        <p>The NAC-1 sets with left-hand rotation and releases with right-hand rotation. The anchor incorporates a field-adjustable emergency shear release system. To shear release the anchor, straight-pull will shear the shear pins at a predetermined shear value.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Drag block design provides better torque resistance than drag springs</li>
            <li>Adjustable straight-pull shear release</li>
            <li>Standard left-hand rotation to set, right-hand rotation to release</li>
            <li>May be run above or below a rod pump</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="J5-features-list__headline">Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prevents tubing movement for better pump efficiency</li>
            <li>Prevents tubing dropping to bottom should the tubing part</li>
            <li>Drag blocks supported with Inconel springs for long service</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="J5-features-list__headline">Operation</h3>
        <p>Install the NAC-1 in the tubing string just above or below the pump for best results. Run to setting depth and rotate the tubing to the left at the anchor. The number of turns required will depend on casing weight, once set the tubing will torque up.</p>
        <p>To ensure the anchor is set, hold the left-hand torque and set down on the anchor, 10,000 to 15,000 lb. Pick it up and set it down several times to ensure set of the anchor. To release, lower the tubing to release tension, and rotate it to the right while working the tubing up and down slightly. Should the anchor not release, straight pull on the tubing above the shear value of the release pins to shear the pins and release the anchor.</p>
