        <p>Specializing in the latest technology, we offer field-proven products that withstand the rigors of oil and gas production. The larger, 48-in. diameter enables greater holding capacity, which leads to longer time intervals between dumping. Plus, unlike its standard vertical and horizontal counterparts, the spherical sand trap enables online sand removal and is ideal for problematic surge applications without sand blow-by.</p>
        <p>For areas where fracking activity is high, our spherical design is preferred. It helps reduce sand particles as low as 100 micron from your flowback stream. When filters can&rsquo;t get the job done, our unique desander can. </p>
        <p>The result is full protection and no sand carryover to your cost-sensitive pieces of production equipment, saving you time, money, and resources. Plus, pre-engineered, inventoried models are eligible for on-demand delivery because we know you need equipment on time.
        </p>

        <h2>Superior sand trap performance</h2>
        <p>Sand traps are designed to remove sand and proppant returning from stimulated wells during drillout, flowback, and early production. Our spherical sand traps offer the best available technology to provide robust service across a wide range of flow conditions. Its spherical design provides superior performance compared to traditional vertical and tangential inlet sand traps, which are limited in capability and in performing within their designed flow rate ranges. As a robust, erosion-resistant, compact, and portable technology that is easy to operate and maintain, our sand traps do not incorporate any screens or filters that require frequent disassembly and cleaning.</p>
        <p>Our spherical sand traps are available in 5,000- and 10,000-psig options on an L-skid. Customized options are available with automated sand dumping, choke manifolds, and a flow iron.</p>
