        <p>Green Thread high-pressure (HP) pipe is a filament-wound product using amine-cured epoxy resins and fiberglass as well as a resin-rich liner reinforced with a surfacing veil for superior corrosion resistance. It is recommended for dilute acids and caustics. Pipe and fittings are available in 1- through 16-in. diameters with pressure ratings up to 450 psig static at a maximum operating temperature of 225 &deg;F; 18- to 24-in. diameters are available upon request. The 1- through 6-in. pipe diameters are available in 20-ft random lengths, and the 8- through 24-in. diameters are in 19- or 39-ft random lengths.</p>
        <p>Green Thread pipe is lightweight compared to steel, black iron, copper, and stainless steel. When considering total installed cost, Green Thread piping provides significant savings due to its light weight and ease of installation. No heavy handling equipment is required, and the load Green Thread pipe adds to a structure is minimal compared to other materials. For example, 4-in. Green Thread pipe weighs only 1.2 lb/ft compared to 5.6 lb for Schedule 10 stainless steel. Green Thred HP fiberglass pipe also carries NSF Standard 61 for potable water service.</p>
