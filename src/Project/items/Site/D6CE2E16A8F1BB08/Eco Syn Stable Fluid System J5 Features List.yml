        <h2>Eco-Syn Stable controls ECD so it doesn&rsquo;t control you</h2>
        <p>FluidControl&rsquo;s Eco-Syn&nbsp;Stable flat rheology synthetic-based drilling fluid system helps you avoid constant readjustment for rheologies to compensate for changing temperatures and pressures. Fueled by our proprietary and ground-breaking Cold Flow rheology modifier, Eco-Syn Stable maintains a consistently flat rheological profile, giving you stress-free management of equivalent circulating densities (ECD) in the extremely narrow fracture gradients intrinsic to the deep and ultra-deep water.&nbsp;In the most fragile formations, our distinctively formulated Eco-Syn Stable system sustains consistent and reliable rheologies, no matter if the temperature is 34 &deg;F or 300 &deg;F or if the pressure is 15 psi or 25,000 psi, allowing you to push casing seats deeper and keep firm control over ECD.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Eco-Syn Stable delivers a stable rheological profile in narrow drilling windows and produces high rates of penetration (ROP). The system functions regardless of temperature, allowing you to drill with comparably lower ECD. In thin fracture gradients, this reduces possibility of differential sticking and severe loss of premium drilling fluid, minimizing costly non-productive time.</p>
        <p>The flexibility of Eco-Syn Stable allows you to formulate systems up to 17 lb/gal. This allows maintenance of necessary persistent properties, including temperature stability of 300&deg;F or more, enabling drilling of ultra-deepwater wells to more than 30,000 ft TD.</p>
        <p>Eco-Syn Stable requires low maintenance and exhibits solids-loading characteristics of a conventional synthetic-based drilling fluid.</p>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Deep and ultra-deep water</li>
        <li>Sub-salt wells</li>
        <li>Narrow fracture gradients</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Eco-Syn Stable also meets offshore discharge regs</h2>
        <p>As an internal olefin (IO) 16/18 synthetic, Eco-Syn Stable is fully compliant with Gulf of Mexico National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations, thereby making it permissible for on-site discharge.</p>
        <p>In addition, Eco-Syn Stable requires less dilution than a standard invert emulsion, further enhancing its environmental and economic advantages.</p>
        <h2>Cold Flow takes temperature out of the equation</h2>
        <p>The FluidControl new-generation Cold Flow rheology modifier minimizes adjustment frequency to account for significant differences between seafloor and bottomhole temperatures, eliminating downhole problems associated with narrow, easily fractured drilling windows.</p>
        <p>Our distinctive Cold Flow modifier is specially engineered to act much like a light switch, activating at a certain temperature and automatically deactivating when the temperature drops without requiring any special treatment or monitoring.</p>
        <p>Compared to conventional synthetic-based fluids, Cold Flow allows the Eco-Syn Stable system to be formulated with less viscosifying clay, which is inherently reactive to cold temperature. Since Eco-Syn Stable does not react, even when seafloor temperatures plunge to as low as 34 &deg;F, it negates the subsequent adverse impact on rheology, allowing operators to push casing seats deeper.</p>
        <p>The Eco-Syn Stable flat rheology synthetic-based drilling fluid system produces rheologies with the same solids content as its conventional counterparts. Flat gel strengths reduce surge and swab during tripping.</p>
        <p>Fann 75 data clearly illustrate the remarkable capacity of Eco-Syn Stable to maintain consistent rheologies even in wells as deep as 32,000 ft TD and in water depths exceeding 8,000 ft. Time and time again, Eco-Syn Stable comes through highly impressive readings in temperatures from 40 to 240 &deg;F and in bottomhole pressures from 2,300 to well over 20,000 psi.</p>
        <p>To learn more about how the Eco-Syn Stable Flat Rheology Synthetic-Based Drilling Fluid System can help you meet all your drilling environmental and economic objectives, contact your nearest FluidControl representative.&nbsp;</p>
