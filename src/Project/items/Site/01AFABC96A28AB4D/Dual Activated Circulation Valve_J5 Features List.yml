        <p>The dual-activated circulation valve offers the traditional method of returning circulation of the toolstring through use of a drop ball. The valve is capable of operating through internal overpressure within the tubing string.</p>
        <p>Conventional dual circulation valves use a burst or rupture disc to return circulation through overpressure. However, the dual-activated circulation valve offers a pressure differential activated piston. The piston activation pressure can be predetermined at the surface through shear pins, offering superior flexibility and considerable savings on redress.</p>
        <p>As with many other tools in the standard BHA tool range, the emphasis is on simplicity, and the dual-activated circulation valve has very few component parts, seals, and thread connections.</p>
        
        <p>When ordering dual-activated circulation valves, please specify size and thread connection.</p>
