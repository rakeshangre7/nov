        <p>Observations and scans of the seabed show that ice has left plow marks as deep as 750 m below surface. This has resulted in the requirement of weak links to be installed on all pipelines in the Arctic region.</p>
        <p>We have developed, qualified, and delivered a considerable amount of standard flowline weak links in various size ranges for this market with a 100% success rate during installation.&nbsp;<br />
        The flowline weak links are highly customizable and easy to redesign, and a swivel version with an automatic released safety valve has also been developed. As an extra feature, a remote-operated vehicle (ROV) safety cover that can activate or deactivate the separation function can be mounted on the outside. The main purpose for this application is to be used as a safety feature on utility lines between subsea equipment and an installation vessel.</p>

        <p>Observations and scans of the seabed show that ice has left plow marks as deep as 750 m below surface. This has resulted in the requirement of weak links to be installed on all pipelines in the Arctic region.</p>
        <p>We have developed, qualified, and delivered a considerable amount of standard flowline weak links in various size ranges for this market with a 100% success rate during installation.</p>
        <p>The flowline weak links are highly customizable and easy to redesign, and a swivel version with an automatic released safety valve has also been developed. As an extra feature, a remote-operated vehicle (ROV) safety cover that can activate or deactivate the separation function can be mounted on the outside. The main purpose for this application is to be used as a safety feature on utility lines between subsea equipment and an installation vessel.</p>
