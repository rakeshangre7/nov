        <p>QT-800 offers increased axial load, cycle life, and reduced ovality growth required for the more demanding applications than the QT-700 while still performing well in sour service.<br />
        <br />
        For the appropriate sizes, QT-800 can be routinely ordered as a True-Taper&trade; string; straight-wall, straight-wall flash-free string; or as a string with an electric wireline or capillary tube installed.</p>

        <p>We are more than just a manufacturer of coiled tubing; we are your partner throughout the entire process. We service the industry with our growing network of service centers, supporting your global operations. Our regional service centers are stocked with finished goods that are targeted at reducing downtime for your projects around the world. We currently lead the coiled tubing industry in total number of international service centers. As an additional service, we have established finished-goods stocking points based on customer demand.</p>
        <h3>Providing the strings you need for your applications</h3>
        <p>At <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EBD57CFEDE134C8A9D38D2CC9F8951A9&amp;_z=z">Quality Tubing</a>, we differentiate our work strings from our permanent installation strings by the applications they will be used for. Work strings are the coiled tubing strings that will be going in and out of the hole, creating fatigue, while permanent installation strings are used in production applications such as plunger lift, velocity strings, or slimhole completions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conventional work-string grades available: QT-800, QT-900, QT-1000, QT-1100, QT-1400</li>
            <li> Conventional permanent-installation string grades available: 16Cr</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also provide advanced thermally processed <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=CFD6D247631340FAA2D7AEAC35BF1A53&amp;_z=z">(ATP) coiled tubing</a>&nbsp;grades, which use state-of-the-art thermal processing throughout the manufacturing process to achieve the most advanced coiled tubing product available on the market.</p>
        <h3>Product development</h3>
        <p>Our product development team works to continuously improve our products and our customer service. Partnering with our quality control lab, failure analyses are performed, free of charge, on customer tubing from the field and with short turnaround time compared to a third-party lab. This gets answers to your operational problems and provides recommendations for remediation, getting you running again as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>We also perform low-cycle fatigue testing on various tubing grades and dimensions with our two fatigue test machines. These tests are done in conjunction with CTES to continuously improve <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DE0D53FCD2854BCE9864C5AA971C4788&amp;_z=z">Cerberus&trade; fatigue modeling software</a>. Our metallurgists also work closely with Quality Tubing&rsquo;s Welding School to develop and improve procedures and to train welders.</p>
        <p>In addition to testing, we work closely with you before, during, and after the sale to provide complete string-design support and analysis for both land and offshore operations. We can also design and implement test plans for unique projects, perform tubing force analysis, and assist with corrosion control and mitigation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
