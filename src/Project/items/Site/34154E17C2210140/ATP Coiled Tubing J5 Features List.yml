        <h3>Process and performance consistency improves your operations</h3>
        
        <p>Through years of research and development and strategic partnerships with leading providers of quench and tempered process equipment, Quality Tubing has developed the most consistent advanced thermally processed (ATP) coiled tubing.</p>
        
        <p>ATP coiled tubing offers a major advantage over conventional coiled tubing in a vast range of applications. The fine-grained thermal processing at the steel manufacturer combined with best-in-class welding technology produces the highest quality green tube possible. Using the highest quality green tube in the final thermal processing step assures that all ATP strings exhibit optimum field performance. The normalization of the bias weld to the parent material in ATP coiled tubing eliminates the bias-weld fatigue spikes, which are often the number-one cause of retirement in the conventional offering.</p>
        
        <p>ATP coiled tubing features a uniform, thermally processed microstructure throughout the entire length of the string, which is instrumental in producing a high-strength product with more consistent and improved field performance. Low-cycle fatigue performance and improved resistance to localized corrosion are consistent in the tube body and the bias weld.</p>
        
        <p>ATP coiled tubing can be manufactured with TRUE-TAPER™ XR, resulting in a coiled tubing string with best-in-class corrosion resistance and extended-reach capabilities that are unmatched in the industry today.</p>
