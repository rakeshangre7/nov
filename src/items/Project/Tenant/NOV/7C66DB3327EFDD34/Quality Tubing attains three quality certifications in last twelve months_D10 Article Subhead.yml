        <p>Always striving to be the best in the market is at the heart of Quality Tubing's business. In the last 6 years, Quality Tubing—a part of our NOV Completion &amp; Production Solutions—went from essentially a nonexistent quality management system (QMS) to a revamped QMS with ISO 9001:2008 certification. Quality Tubing was an early adopter of ISO 9001:2015 certification in 2018 and added API Q1 and API 5ST monogramming certification to its list of professional QMS certifications in 2019, all of which provide additional value to customers. Kevin Elliott, Quality Tubing product engineering manager, says, "Accreditation with the ability to monogram our products to API 5ST will make Quality Tubing more competitive in several markets. It made sense to pursue this accreditation, and we expect this to improve our brand's position in the market."</p>
