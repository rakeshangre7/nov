        <p>“NOV is persevering through a pandemic that is presenting historic and extraordinary challenges to the oil and gas industry on several fronts,” commented Clay Williams, Chairman, President, and CEO. “Our team did a great job in the first quarter navigating government-mandated shutdowns, facility closures, and logistical challenges in many regions around the world to meet our customers’ needs, all while maintaining a safe working environment for our employees.”</p>
        
        <p>“The current COVID-19 crisis is driving a historic drop in global demand for oil, which has resulted in the collapse of prices and forced unprecedented well shut-ins. While we find ourselves in what is likely to be one of the most severe downturns in our industry’s 161-year history, NOV is well-positioned to weather the storm, with a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and a focus on cost control. We expect this downturn to get much worse during the second quarter, so we are intensifying our cost-cutting efforts to position NOV appropriately for the challenges ahead.”</p>
        
        <p>“Since year-end, we have raised our target for the cost-out program we initiated in the second quarter of 2019 by $395 million and we have reduced our planned 2020 capital expenditures by approximately 25% to $250 million. In times like these, NOV’s leading market positions, technology, global footprint, product portfolio diversity, and customer-focus are more critical than ever in ensuring that we both endure and prosper.”</p>
        
        <p>NOV had several significant achievements this quarter:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>NOV’s employees are working to help support the global community during the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts include donating personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies to front line emergency personnel and delivering portable generation systems from NOV’s WellSite Services business to provide critical power and air-conditioning to COVID-19 quarantine, testing, and distribution centers. Additionally, an NOV engineer helped design a low-cost mechanical ventilator and is now working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to validate the design and create a 3D model that will be used to print the ventilator using additive manufacturing.</li>
        <li>NOV was awarded an integrated drilling equipment package to upgrade an offshore semi-tender rig. The package includes key NOV technologies including the drilling control system, hoisting and drill floor equipment, pressure control equipment, and solids control systems. </li>
        <li>NOV was awarded contracts from a major Japanese construction company for the design and equipment package associated with an offshore wind turbine installation vessel scheduled for delivery in late 2022. </li>
        <li>NOV's 14½-in. TKC76 ION™ 3D cutter technology achieved new ROP records in both the Balam and the Maloob fields in the Marine Region in Mexico. </li>
        <li>NOV booked its first mooring tension dampener system contract with a major international operator for a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility operating on a project in Africa. </li>
        <li>NOV deployed its Vector™ Rotary Steerable System (RSS) for the first time in Australia, marking the milestone of Vector RSS tools’ deployment on all six inhabited continents. </li>
        <li>NOV delivered an APL™ buoy turret loading (BTL) system to the Jubilee field in West Africa that will operate in approximately 3,000 ft of water and allow commercial tankers to offload up to one million bbl of oil in 27 hours. </li>
        <li>NOV signed a four-year contract to supply more than 85 miles of oil production, gas lift and water injection flexible pipe for post-salt fields in Brazil.</li>
        <li>NOV successfully signed a new drill bit contract with a national oil company in the Middle East after demonstrating the substantial value created for the customer by using ReedHycalog™ drill bits. </li>
        <li>NOV was awarded a contract to use Thru-Kote™ sleeves and TK fittings to internally coat nearly 60 km of pipeline for the Llanito and Casabe fields in Colombia. This will represent the region’s first major internally-coated pipeline.</li>
        <li>NOV expanded its optimization services offerings by introducing two new products that expand the use of its IntelliServ™ high-speed telemetry technology. First, NOV introduced its iCon-RT tool, which leverages IntelliServ’s real-time, broadband data transmission to optimize completion operations. NOV also introduced its new data while tripping (DWT) device, which provides previously unavailable real-time data during tripping operations by combing along string measurement (ASM), enhanced measurement system (EMS), and the WDP network, and overcoming the historical need to use a drillpipe’s fixed connection to the top drive and pumping operations to provide real-time, high-speed data delivery while tripping.</li>
        </ul>
