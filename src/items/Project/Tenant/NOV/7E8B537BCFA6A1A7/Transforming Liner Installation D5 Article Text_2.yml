      Value: "<p>An independent operator was planning a major 11-well field development in the North Sea that included installation of long, 4&frac12;-in. completion liners. Successful completion-liner deployment was identified as a major risk and, despite the expected positive impact of using managed-pressure-drilling techniques, a strong understanding of downhole dynamics during liner deployment remained a challenge. This issue was compounded by the fact that the new campaign included significantly longer laterals than previous campaigns, with complicated lithology, varying pore pressures, and open hole stability concerns.</p>"
