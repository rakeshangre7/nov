        <p>CBM for liquid nitrogen monitors the condition of LN2 in the pumps and piping while simultaneously observing wear components.<br />
        <br />
        Description<br />
        <br />
        Visual guidance is provided to the operator to optimize equipment operations.<br />
        <br />
        To ensure the system is aligned with your team&rsquo;s desired goals, we work closely with you to determine specific equipment and data points to monitor. This system monitors and visually reports the current health of equipment, subsystems, and processes, including your boost pump, high-pressure pump, and vaporizer.<br />
        <br />
        Boost pump monitoring Cool-Down Cooling down the pump and piping is monitored with sensors before and after pumping. We have a proven method to detect when the piping is full of LN2. Once the boost-pump indicator is green, it is safe to start a slow rotation of the pump&rsquo;s drive.<br />
        <br />
        Prime While priming the pump, it is important to watch for premature gassing of the LN2. The CBM system provides the continuous monitoring required to report the condition of the LN2 in the piping to the operator. If the visual indicator changes to yellow, stop the pump and wait for the LN2 to stabilize.<br />
        <br />
        Operation Operators adjust the boost pump speed as the system demands change. The chance for unexpected wear increases if the boost pump is operated outside of the system&rsquo;s required pressure.<br />
        <br />
        Vaporizer Maintaining the proper energy in the vaporizer is important for process stability. New operators are challenged with this task due to the difficulty of understanding the energy requirement for LN2 and the energy produced by the vaporizer. Providing the CBM system with the targeted discharge temperature enables proper monitoring of the vaporizer.<br />
        <br />
        Heat Recovery Sensors are used to calculate the required energy from the water brake or hydraulic heat builder to achieve a stable discharge temperature. The vaporizer scale changes based on the status of the heat input.<br />
        <br />
        Direct-fired Fired vaporizers require clean-burning fuel to minimize excess smoke and collection of soot within the burner. The CBM system has a proven method of monitoring the balance of fuel and air to achieve the ideal internal temperature required for the target discharge temperature.<br />
        <br />
        High-Pressure Pump Monitoring Cool-Down Cooling down the cold ends is monitored with well-placed sensors that detect when the cold ends are full of stable LN2, and the visual coach provides the green scale to let the operator know it is safe to prime the cold ends.<br />
        <br />
        Prime The first few rotations of the pump will cause destabilization of the LN2 inside the cold ends, causing the yellow scale to show the operator to use caution.<br />
        <br />
        Operation The CBM system monitors for the proper amount of liquid in each cold end. Deviations are shown via the boost-pump indicator, so the operator may adjust the boost pressure as needed. While not enough LN2 causes cavitation, too much pressure from the boost pump induces extra load on the pump that can result in premature wear.<br />
        <br />
        Wear Monitoring Vibration sensors and oil-condition monitoring sensors observe the health of the high-pressure pump. Abnormal vibrations on the high-pressure pump trigger alarms while the oil condition is continuously reported to the visual display in a separate screen. The high-pressure pump scale changes based on oil condition and vibration.</p>

        <p>CBM for liquid nitrogen monitors the condition of LN<sub>2</sub> in the pumps and piping while simultaneously observing wear components.</p>
        <p>Visual guidance is provided to the operator to optimize equipment operations.</p>
        <p>To ensure the system is aligned with your team's desired goals, we work closely with you to determine specific equipment and data points to monitor. This system monitors and visually reports the current health of equipment, subsystems, and processes, including your boost pump, high-pressure pump, and vaporizer.</p>
        <h2>Boost pump monitoring</h2>
        <p><strong>Cool-down</strong></p>
        <p>Cooling down the pump and piping is monitored with sensors before and after pumping. We have a proven method to detect when the piping is full of LN<sub>2</sub>. Once the boost-pump indicator is green, it is safe to start a slow rotation of the pump's drive.</p>
        <p><strong>Prime</strong></p>
        <p>While priming the pump, it is important to watch for premature gassing of the LN<sub>2</sub>. The CBM system provides the continuous monitoring required to report the condition of the LN<sub>2</sub> in the piping to the operator. If the visual indicator changes to yellow, stop the pump and wait for the LN<sub>2</sub> to stabilize.</p>
        <p><strong>Operation</strong></p>
        <p>Operators adjust the boost pump speed as the system demands change. The chance for unexpected wear increases if the boost pump is operated outside of the system's required pressure.</p>
        <h2>Vaporizer</h2>
        <p>Maintaining the proper energy in the vaporizer is important for process stability. New operators are challenged with this task due to the difficulty of understanding the energy requirement for LN<sub>2</sub> and the energy produced by the vaporizer. Providing the CBM system with the targeted discharge temperature enables proper monitoring of the vaporizer.</p>
        <p><strong>Heat recovery</strong></p>
        <p>Sensors are used to calculate the required energy from the water brake or hydraulic heat builder to achieve a stable discharge temperature. The vaporizer scale changes based on the status of the heat input.</p>
        <p><strong>Direct-fired</strong></p>
        <p>Fired vaporizers require clean-burning fuel to minimize excess smoke and collection of soot within the burner. The CBM system has a proven method of monitoring the balance of fuel and air to achieve the ideal internal temperature required for the target discharge temperature.</p>
        <h2>High-pressure pump monitoring</h2>
        <p><strong>Cool-down</strong></p>
        <p>Cooling down the cold ends is monitored with well-placed sensors that detect when the cold ends are full of stable LN2, and the visual coach provides the green scale to let the operator know it is safe to prime the cold ends.</p>
        <p><strong>Prime</strong></p>
        <p>The first few rotations of the pump will cause destabilization of the LN2 inside the cold ends, causing the yellow scale to show the operator to use caution.</p>
        <p><strong>Operation</strong></p>
        <p>The CBM system monitors for the proper amount of liquid in each cold end. Deviations are shown via the boost-pump indicator, so the operator may adjust the boost pressure as needed. While not enough LN2 causes cavitation, too much pressure from the boost pump induces extra load on the pump that can result in premature wear.</p>
        <p><strong>Wear monitoring</strong></p>
        <p>Vibration sensors and oil-condition monitoring sensors observe the health of the high-pressure pump. Abnormal vibrations on the high-pressure pump trigger alarms while the oil condition is continuously reported to the visual display in a separate screen. The high-pressure pump scale changes based on oil condition and vibration.</p>
