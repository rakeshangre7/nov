        <p>The hydraulic self-contained safety system (HSCSS) is a highly reliable control system for shutdown valves (SDV) or surface safety valves (SSV). The low-cost HSCSS is designed specifically for remote locations where external power sources are not available. However, it functions equally well in all applications requiring a basic shutdown system such as wellhead Christmas trees and pipelines.</p>
        <p>The standard system features high- and low-pressure shutdown functions, a high-temperature shutdown function (fusible element), and an emergency shutdown (ESD) function. Control of the subsurface safety valve is an optional feature available with all models.</p>
        <p>This system is completely self contained and only requires that the operator manually pressurize the hydraulic system to put the safety system in service, opening the valve and arming the high-flow&nbsp; hydraulic pressure sensors.</p>
        <p>When the system is put in service, the valve remains open until an event triggers the shutdown sequence. The shutdown sequence ends with the actuator failing to the safe position.</p>
