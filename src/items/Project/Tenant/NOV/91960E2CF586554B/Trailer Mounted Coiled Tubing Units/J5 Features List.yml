        <p>We have the most extensive line of land-unit configurations of any manufacturer on the market today.<br />
        <br />
        For areas that have requirements for large-diameter tubing or extremely long string lengths, we offer Hydra Rig trailer designs that carry nothing but the tubing reel that can work in conjunction with any trailer-mounted unit for offering extended-reach coiled tubing work. These units are generally oversized for normal transport and are used in areas where size and weight are not issues.</p>
