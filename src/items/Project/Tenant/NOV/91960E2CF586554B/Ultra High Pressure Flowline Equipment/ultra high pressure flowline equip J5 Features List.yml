        <p>The Anson™ brand has been synonymous with quality well-service products for over 35 years. Our original values—quality and a true customer focus— remain at the forefront of the company ethos. With a global network, we provide our customers with technical, sales, and service outlets close to their operations. We have been supplying top-quality 20,000-psi into the oilfield for over 15 years.
        </p>
        <p>
        We offer Anson Figure 2002 standard service flowline equipment in 2-, 3-, and 4-in. nominal pipe sizes with 1.25-, 2-, and 3-in. bores. The Anson flowline range is not limited to the items shown. Please speak to your local NOV sales representative for further details on any of our other offerings.
        </p>
        <h2>Figure 2002 pup joints
        </h2>
        <p>Our unique manufacturing process produces an inherently stronger product. Smooth uninterrupted bores and no welds eliminate the need for post-weld heat treatment and reduce routine inspection time. Used as interconnecting pipework between equipment, these come standard with integral non-welded hammer union ends and in lengths up to 10 ft.
        </p>
        <h2>Figure 2002 swivel joints
        </h2>
        <p>Anson swivel joints provide freedom of movement when making up temporary pipework. Designed using materials and processes to last longer in the harshest environments, our full range of swivel joints—in both journal and ball-bearing designs—allows low-torque rotation within a high-pressure flowline setup.
        </p>
        <h2>Figure 2002 plug valves
        </h2>
        <p>Anson Premier plug valves are a low-torque, quarter-turn valve used to isolate sections of flowline. They are the valve of choice when space is limited and a quick shut off is required. Our plug valves have a robust and low-maintenance compact design. They have been used globally in many severe service applications for the last 30 years.
        <br /><br />Our Premier plug valve is a tapered (wipe clean) design, preventing contaminants from entering the cavity. The tapered housing closes the gaps between sealing surfaces preventing ingress of solids during operation. In operation, the sealing surface on the plug is wiped clean on rotation from being in constant contact with the valve inserts, making it ideally suited for fracturing service.
        <br /><br />Available from 1- to 4-in. full-bore for pressures up to 20,000 psi, all Anson plug valves are pressure-balanced type and have replaceable inserts between the body and plug. Anson plug valves are supplied as standard with manual actuation—either a handle or hand wheel with gearbox. They can also be fitted with hydraulic, pneumatic, or electric actuators upon request.<br /></p>
        <h2>Figure 2002 check valves
        </h2>
        <p>Our high-quality Anson™ check valves are preferred by many service companies due to their dependability in today's harsh environments. Allowing flow in one direction, when the flow stops or reverses direction the valve shuts, blocking fluid or pressure from travelling back over. The swing type check valve uses a flapper style closing mechanism. A hinged flapper assembly is seated in the valve. When fluid flows through the inlet it moves the flapper into the open position and passes through to the outlet. When flow stops the flapper closes against the seat and prevents back flow towards the inlet.
        </p>
        <p>Figure 2002 union fittings
        </p>
        <p>From elbows and tees to crosses and laterals, we have a complete range of integral Figure 2002 union fittings to integrate into your flowline assembly including elbows, tees, crosses, laterals, wyes, and crossovers—all with Anson hammer union connections across the size range. Full material traceability is supplied as standard.

        <h2>Figure 2002 pressure relief valve
        </h2>
        <p>
        A pressure relief valve (PRV), sometimes referred to as a ‘pop off valve’, is a safety valve designed to protect against over pressure from pump supply in the flowline and is set to open at a preset pressure. Hydraulic pressure in the system acts directly on the ball and seat arrangement of the valve. When the system is at or below the set pressure, the ball will remain seated checking flow. Once the line pressure becomes greater than the set pressure, the ball will begin to unseat and relieve pressure through the outlet. The valve is self-resetting and the disc-spring arrangement provides a fast reseating action once normal operating conditions resume. </p>
