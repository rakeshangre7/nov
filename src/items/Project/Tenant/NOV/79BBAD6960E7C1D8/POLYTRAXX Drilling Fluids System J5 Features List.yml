        <p><strong>A water-based drilling fluids system that minimizes costs without sacrificing performance</strong></p>
        <p>As the field-proven economic alternative to both oil-based drilling mud systems and other premium water-based systems, the new FluidControl Polytraxx&trade; water-based fluids system delivers the drilling rates required without the environmental and economic limitations of non-aqueous fluids.</p>
        <p>Polytraxx eliminates the costs associated with non-aqueous fluids such as diesel usage, disposal, trucking, and more while delivering the superior drilling fluids performance required for demanding drilling environments like unconventional shale plays. One operator who drilled 224 wells in the Eagle Ford shale using our Polytraxx system estimated cost savings of $300,000 per well for a total savings of $73.2 million.</p>
        <p>Also able to be designed and formulated for any individual drilling fluids system, Polytraxx can operate anywhere in the world, including on land or offshore.</p>
        <p><strong>The environmentally friendly option</strong></p>
        <p>Polytraxx is designed for low consumption of non-renewable resources such as water, and its impressive inhibition and waste management benefits result in lower dilution rates compared to other water-based systems. This results in reduced waste volumes and enables fluid recycling. The Polytraxx system itself is also easy to mix, maintain, and recycle.</p>
        <p><strong>Less work for the same drilling fluids performance</strong></p>
        <p>Designed with a high tolerance to contaminants, Polytraxx consistently reduces lost circulation and delivers a stable wellbore. This water-based drilling fluids system does not require as much equipment, manpower, and secondary processing as other drilling fluid systems.</p>
        <p>In one example application, Polytraxx helped eliminate nonproductive time (NPT) and reduce drilling time by 8 days for an approximately total cost savings of more than $2.5 million across 16 wells.</p>
