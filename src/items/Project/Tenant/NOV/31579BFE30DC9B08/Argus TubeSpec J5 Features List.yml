        <p>In today's complex wellsite environments, coiled tubing failure can occur as a result of mechanical damage due to erosion, corrosion, tensile overload, and abrasion. These failures are not only costly but time consuming for both you and your customers.</p>
        
        <p>While most ultrasonic transducer methods require clean water to couple the ultrasonic probe to the material measured, the Argus TubeSpec™ uses a polyurethane element as a medium between the sensor and the coiled tubing, eliminating the need for water coupling. The polyurethane element (a solid) exhibits excellent wear characteristics. When compressed, the element transforms to exhibit the attributes of a liquid, filling changes in the surface contour of the tubing. The polyurethane element is therefore not contaminated by the environment, and accurate circumferential wall thickness measurements can be made. These measurements allow you to evaluate the coiled tubing’s wall thickness along the string.</p>
