        <p>We offer a standard package or a customized solution to meet your specific operational needs. The trailer is typically used in conjunction with tensioner trailers and other equipment dedicated to deploying and assembling electric power lines.</p>
        <p>Cable support spindles and brakes can be customer specified. They are built into the trailer frame at two positions, which are designed to hold cable spools weighing up to 30,000 lb each, with a maximum spool outside diameter of 96 in. and width of 68 in. The trailer structure has two outside wide flange beams with kingpin plate structures, transitional primary cross members, and standard cross members.</p>
        <p>A fairlead structure at the rear of the trailer may be deployed and used to control cable connecting to the tensioner unit. A vertical cable handling structure at the rear of the trailer can be laid down and fastened to deck for road travel.</p>
