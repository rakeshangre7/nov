        <p>But in other cases, a journey of only a few feet can be just as costly as thousands of miles.</p>
        <p>National Drilling Company (NDC) has partnered with NOV since the early 1980s. In recent years, their powerful rigs exceeded the size and weight limits for standard moving systems, requiring that rigs be dismantled and reassembled for moves of only a few feet. Each cycle lost almost 10 days of productive time and increased the risk of equipment damage and failure.</p>
        <p>NDC found the solution in the powerful, 16-tire rig moving system that safely transports even the largest rigs without dismantling. Moving everything in one piece reduces the normal downtime of each move to an average of 60 hours - a 75 percent reduction that could potentially save customers up to $500k per move.</p>
