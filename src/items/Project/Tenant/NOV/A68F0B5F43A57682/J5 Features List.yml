        The NP-200 high-pressure pumps are specifically designed to deliver high flow rates at high pressure while providing exceptional low flow rate turndown.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The NP-200 triplex nitrogen pump is designed for durability. Low-friction roller and ball bearings are used rather than common journal bearings. This significantly enhances durability, particularly at low speeds at which journal bearings are most vulnerable.<br />
        <br />
        The design also operates at a wider temperature range and produces less heat in the bearings. This means less lube oil system requirements for preheating and cooling the lube oil.<br />
        <br />
        The welded steel case design enables strength where it is needed while reducing excess weight. Steel construction gives ductility and enables repairs if damaged. This design is compact in size for minimal footprint when installed. Typical hydraulic drive packaging enhances flexible installation of the nitrogen pump without drive shafts to align.<br />
        <br />
        Many cold-end brands may be mounted to the NP-200 pump for flexibility in use.
