        <h2>The future of fracturing is now &ndash; built on legacy, focused on the future</h2>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>Our Ideal&trade; electric fracturing (eFrac) fleet provides the advanced fracturing technology you expect from NOV while dramatically reducing harmful emissions and making a substantial impact on your total cost of ownership. With a clean and simple rig up, our Ideal fleet significantly increases power density while maintaining the redundancy that efficient frac operations require. At a time when the industry is looking towards greener solutions, the Ideal fleet provides an environmentally and socially responsible option that&rsquo;s less disruptive to communities and minimizes sound pressure in the area of operation.
        </p>
        <p>
        By design, conventional frac operations require continuous pumping, resulting in high fuel costs, increased emissions, and equipment reliability issues for conventional frac fleets. Electric equipment is a proven method for achieving performance with simplified drive trains, and our Ideal fleet relies on that same concept to provide a reliable fracing solution at a lower cost of ownership. From precise control of the chemical injection to more reliable operation of the frac pumps, our eFrac system offers enhanced process control, consistent performance, and better equipment feedback. The Ideal fleet features 5,000-hp, electric-driven pumps that eliminate costs related to engines and transmissions, and the system has fewer pump bores to service, resulting in a cleaner, less maintenance-intensive frac fleet. To power this equipment, we made our Ideal system generator agnostic, providing truly accessible electric power whether it&rsquo;s a Highline power supply, centralized field power, or a frac-friendly mobile power generator.
        </p>
        <p>As with any frac operation, safety is the highest priority. Our design criteria was focused on making the electrical power systems a safe, reliable option for fracing, and we reduced risk and complexity in all areas&mdash;from electrical hook up to rigging iron&mdash;to produce a highly organized, simple-to-understand system. As the first fully remote-operated frac fleet, the Ideal fleet centralizes knowledge to a single location on the well pad and removes personnel from hazardous equipment and environments. Additionally, our Ideal system&rsquo;s blender complies with upcoming silica regulations and removes the need for personnel to feed chemicals during the pumping operation.
        </p>
        <p>Our Ideal eFrac frac fleet sets the bar high when it comes to efficient, environmentally conscious fracing systems.</p>
