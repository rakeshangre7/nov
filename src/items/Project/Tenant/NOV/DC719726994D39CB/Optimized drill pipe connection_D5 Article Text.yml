        <p>Delta is Grant Prideco's premium drill pipe connection, designed to be used in batch drilling applications and extended-reach wells typical of onshore operations. After receiving extensive feedback, the connection was developed to perfectly align cost with performance. Through more than 2.25 million feet of Delta in use around the world, this philosophy has been validated with a 3 to 4% recut rate &mdash; far below the industry average.</p>
        <p>In two projects in the Middle East and one in the U.S., operators realized significant benefits from using Delta connections and changing their string design. These benefits included substantial efficiency gains with faster makeup/breakout, reduced drilling times, and the ability to use higher flowrates and levels of hydraulic horsepower.</p>
