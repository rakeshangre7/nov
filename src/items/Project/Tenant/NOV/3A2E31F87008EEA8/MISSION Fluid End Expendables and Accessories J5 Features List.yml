        <h2>We develop high-quality, field-proven fluid end expendables and accessories for all pump manufacturers to provide extended run times and longer service life.</h2>
        <h3>Mud pump liners</h3>
        <p>Our Mission ceramic, chrome iron sleeved, and hardened steel liners are manufactured using only the highest-grade materials and offer extended run times with excellent resistance to abrasion, erosion, and corrosion.</p>
        <h3>Mud pump piston rods</h3>
        <p>We manufacture crosshead extension rods, quick connect rods, self-aligning rod assemblies, and piston rods for all types of mud pump manufacturers. All Mission rods are manufactured from high-quality materials and machined to exact tolerances to provide long life and superior service.</p>
        <h3>Mud pump pistons</h3>
        <p>We offer pistons of all styles and compositions designed for various types of drilling applications. All pistons are designed to provide consistent run times, minimize downtime, and reduce maintenance.</p>
        <h3>Drilling valves and seats</h3>
        <p>Our line of roughneck valves and seats sets industry standards by meeting the demands of today&rsquo;s hostile drilling environments encountered by contractors worldwide.</p>
        <h3>Custom dies and inserts</h3>
        <p>Our dies and inserts are accurately machined and heat treated to provide the best resistance to wear in the harshest environments.</p>
        <h3>Fluid end modules</h3>
        <p>Our fluid end expendables and modules are machined to exacting standards to ensure reliable performance for all legacy mud pumps brands, including Continental Emsco, Ideco, National, Oilwell, and Skytop Brewster.</p>
        <h3>Blak-Jak equipment</h3>
        <p>Our Mission Blak-Jak equipment line consists of tools that allow safer and faster change-out times for liners, valves, retainers, washpipe, and more. These tools are designed to reduce downtime from fluid end expendables and improve safety for rig floor personnel.</p>
