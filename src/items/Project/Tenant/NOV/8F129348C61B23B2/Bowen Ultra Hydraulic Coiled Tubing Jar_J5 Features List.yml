        <p>The fishing grab retrieves wire that has broken in the tubing.</p>
        
        <p>The tool consists of a box up connection in a housing with either two or three flexible prongs extending downward. Pointed barbs welded to the inside of the prongs form hooks that will catch the looped end of the broken line. The coiled tubing fishing grab also has a large flow through bore.</p>
        
        <p>When a line breaks below the stuffing box, a full gauge such as a slotted skirt wirefinder is normally used to both locate and ball up the broken end of the line before running the fishing grab. The fishing grab is flexible enough to bend and can be gauged for the tubing it is to be run in. The prong ends of the grab should fit snugly against the walls of the tubing to help prevent line bypass.</p>
        
        <p>For further details and available sizes, please contact NOV.</p>

        <p>The Bowen™ Ultra coiled tubing (CT) jar is a bidirectional hydraulic CT jarring assembly designed to operate in conjunction with the coiled tubing jar intensifier. This jar’s unique design allows for easy, dependable, and hard-hitting operation, with no setting or adjustment required before going in the hole or during operation. The assembly allows the operator to easily control the intensity of jarring impacts by varying the applied load. The jar can deliver a wide range of impacts, from low to very high impact and impulse forces. The new patent-pending technology within the assembly allows the tool to deliver higher impacts.</p>
        
        <p>To complement the new Ultra CT jar, we have designed a jar placement program that provides impacts at the stuck point for service companies and operators to use.</p>
        
        <p>The CT jar placement program:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Impacts at the stuck point, not just the jar</li>
        <li>Allows the service company to optimize the BHA to deliver the hardest impact and impulse</li>
        <li>Considers configuration and length of fish, hole profile, friction, mud weight effects, CT size, etc.</li>
        <li>Is designed only for NOV tools; all calculations and results are based on NOV tools</li>
        <li>Can be downloaded by customers for free at nov.com</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>NOV offers free technical support on the program and our tools 24/7 at 1-888-DHT-TOOL.</p>
        
        <p>We will run jar impact calculations for customers through the 24-hour hotline.</p>

        <p>The Bowen&trade; Ultra coiled tubing (CT) jar is a bidirectional hydraulic CT jarring assembly designed to operate in conjunction with the coiled tubing jar intensifier. This jar&rsquo;s unique design allows for easy, dependable, and hard-hitting operation, with no setting or adjustment required before going in the hole or during operation. The assembly allows the operator to easily control the intensity of jarring impacts by varying the applied load. The jar can deliver a wide range of impacts, from low to very high impact and impulse forces. The new patent-pending technology within the assembly allows the tool to deliver higher impacts.</p>
        <p>To complement the new Ultra CT jar, we have designed a jar placement program that provides impacts at the stuck point for service companies and operators to use.</p>
        <p>The CT jar placement program:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Impacts at the stuck point, not just the jar</li>
            <li>Allows the service company to optimize the BHA to deliver the hardest impact and impulse</li>
            <li>Considers configuration and length of fish, hole profile, friction, mud weight effects, CT size, etc.</li>
            <li>Is designed only for NOV tools; all calculations and results are based on NOV tools</li>
            <li>Can be downloaded by customers for free at nov.com</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NOV offers free technical support on the program and our tools 24/7 at 1-888-DHT-TOOL.</p>
        <p>We will run jar impact calculations for customers through the 24-hour hotline.</p>
