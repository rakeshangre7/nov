      Hint: description
      Value: <p>Our Hydrodynamic Brake consists of a stationary half (stator) and a rotary half (rotor). The stator is bolted into the housing while the rotor is coupled to the shaft, and during normal operation the rotor spins freely. When the unit goes into backspin, the rotor begins to rotate in the counterclockwise direction, allowing the working fluid to be forced to the outside of the rotor and creating a circular flow path inside the brake cavity. As the energized fluid from the rotor comes into contact with the stationary fins of the stator, the energy is transferred to the stator and back to the working fluid as heat. Small amounts of working fluid are continually removed from the system and replaced with new fluid. The working fluid contained in the drivehead reservoir is used as the braking medium, enabling the energy stored in the fluid column and rod string to safely dissipate without the drivehead reaching excessive backspin speeds.</p>
