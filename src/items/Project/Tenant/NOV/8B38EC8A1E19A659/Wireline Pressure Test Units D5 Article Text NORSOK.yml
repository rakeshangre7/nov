        <p>The NORSOK pressure test skid unit features a high-volume circuit for rapid filling and a high-pressure circuit for raising to final pressure. Another identical pair of circuits provides 100% redundancy. Primary power is provided by an electrically driven hydraulic pump. Three modes of operation are provided; local manual control (standalone) and passive safety systems, local manual control with electrical monitoring/recording and active safety systems enabled, and local manual operation with remote monitoring/recording and access to active safety systems. Unit features a local graphical interface displaying and recording pressure, flow and system parameters.</p>
        <p>Three selectable pressure settings are provided on the unit to protect against overpressure during testing. These levels are set at 6,500, 10,000, and 15,000 psi. These can be set by a three-way valve for manual operations. The SmartMonitor will require the pressure setting to be set when starting the system.</p>
        <p>The unit is mounted within a weather-resistant container certified in accordance with DNV 2.7-1 and BS EN12079. All controls, reels, and tanks are mounted inside the container behind secure, lockable doors. Pipe fittings, tubing, and fasteners are made from stainless steel.</p>
