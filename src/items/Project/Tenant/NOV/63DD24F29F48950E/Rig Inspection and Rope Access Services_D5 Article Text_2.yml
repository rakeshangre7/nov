        <h2>Dropped Objects Survey</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Offshore and onshore, dropped objects are the main cause of incidents throughout the oil and gas industry. To prevent dropped objects incidents and maintain a safe working environment, our rope access inspectors complete a thorough inspection of the operating environment. During the inspection a list is compiled of all potential drop items in the work area along with the risk category, location, fastening/secondary retaining method, and recommended corrective actions. A photograph of each risk is included in the report.</p>
        <p>Customers have access to our web-based reporting software and, upon completion of the survey, will receive an inspection book containing valuable information from the DROPS survey.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Lifting Gear Inspection</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A lifting gear survey (LGI) is a third-party inspection of lifting equipment, including lifting accessories and lifting appliances. An LGI survey is vital for safety and is mandatory in many parts of the world. Our LEEA-qualified teams inspect all types of lifting accessories and equipment, conducting complete surveys of installations on the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Offshore oil rigs</li>
            <li>Land rigs</li>
            <li>Floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) units</li>
            <li>Supply vessels</li>
            <li>Lifting equipment</li>
            <li>Offshore containers</li>
            <li>Cranes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inspection packages are conducted in accordance with LOLER, American Petroleum Institute (API), and British and European standards as well as any client-specific standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
