        <p>NOV&rsquo;s TRSV Communication (COMM) is a wireline-deployed accessory tool designed to establish secondary hydraulic communication within tubing-retrievable downhole safety valves. Once the tubing safety valve is communicated, a hydraulically controlled, secondary wireline-inserted safety valve can be installed to allow continued production.</p>
        <p>The COMM is deployed with standard wireline equipment (spang jar and weight bars) until it lands on the no-go shoulder within the safety valve. Mechanical jarring engages the COMM&rsquo;s 360&deg; radial expansion dogs within a recess located above the hydraulic piston and below the lock profile polished bore. Upward mechanical jarring engages the radial expansion dogs with the safety valve communication feature until hydraulic communication is established. Continued jarring shears the mechanical release and allows the tool to collapse back into the running condition for recovery.</p>
        <p>The COMM is a simple, proven, and robust accessory tool for safety valve hydraulic communication operations. It does not require fluid within the well or additional wellbore hydraulic pressure to successfully function. The tool is simple to field redress and can be easily configured to run in a variety of different lock profiles.</p>
        <p>Contact NOV for specific tool application information. Reference the appropriate safety valve technical operating manual for more information.</p>
