        <p>With the continuous advancement in drilling and completion technologies, your coiled tubing strings are being pushed to their limits. Coiled tubing operations now include deployment into horizontal wells with lateral sections exceeding 10,000 ft as well as the use of downhole tools that require more than 5,000 psi internal circulating pressure.<br />
        <br />
        QT-1400 is the next generation of ultra-high-strength coiled tubing with a minimum yield strength of 140,000 psi. This makes it the highest-strength coiled tubing in the world. Higher-strength coiled tubing with greater resistance to low-cycle fatigue cracking at high pressure and broader ranges of potential string designs is vital for success in these increasingly challenging environments. Ultra-high-strength coiled tubing, with a proven track record of manufacturing excellence, allows you to provide solutions to your customers&rsquo; most difficult problems and give them confidence in your operational capabilities.<br />
        <br />
        For the appropriate sizes, QT-1400 can be routinely ordered as a True-Taper&trade; or True-Taper XR string; straight-wall string; or as a string with an electric wireline or capillary tube installed. QT-1400 is manufactured from high-strength, low-alloy steel (HSLAS) with alloying additions to provide resistance to atmospheric corrosion.</p>
