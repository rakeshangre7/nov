        <p>We offer a range of complete fail-safe close shutdown valves in either pneumatic or hydraulic styles to ensure surface safety during fracking operations. Using hydraulic or pneumatic power to open and line pressure/spring return force to close, the frac tree shutdown valves can be supplied with quick exhaust valves to reduce valve closure time.</p>
        <p>During operation, pneumatic or hydraulic control pressure enters the cylinder. The extended stem travels downward, indicating the valve is open. The adjustable down-stop prevents further downward movement. The gate valve is now fully open. The actuator is designed to maintain the (reverse-acting) valve in the open position with pneumatic or hydraulic pressure in the actuator.</p>
        <p>Loss of control pressure allows line pressure in the valve body and spring force to move the stem and gate into the closed position.</p>
        <p>The extended stem indicates the valve is closed. The metal-to-metal seat between the actuator bonnet and lower stem serves as a secondary seal.</p>
        <p>Upstream valve body pressure helps to isolate line pressure from downstream with less than 100 psi in the valve body.</p>

        <li>Lightweight and quick disconnect – Easy to install and maintain, this unit can be redressed without special tools or external pressure sources.</li>
        <li>Large diaphragm area on AUD actuators – This permits use of a low-pressure air or gas control system. A relief valve on the cylinder acts to protect against damage to the diaphragm in case of excessive pressure increases.</li>
