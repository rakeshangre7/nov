        <h2>VMA-I </h2>
        <p>The VMA-I series vertically plate-mounted agitator shares the same design principles as the legacy VMA series. The VMA-I features a C-face motor that minimizes maintenance and maximizes reliability. The helical gearbox is equipped with a strong output shaft bearing rather than the drop bearing configuration.</p>
        <h2>Impellers </h2>
        <p>Impellers are available with flat blades (radial flow), contour blades (axial flow), and canted blades (radial/axial flow). The impellers are sized according to tank volume and expected duty. Active mud system compartments such as solids removal sections, mud mixing sections, and slug pits—which need a higher shear force to produce immediate mixing—are another consideration in impeller sizing.</p>
        <h2>Shafts </h2>
        <p>Several types of shafts are offered. Mild steel shafts are cut to length and joined to the gearbox output shaft with a rigid coupling. Solid shafts are keyed at the bottom for impeller height adjustment. Hollow pipe shafts are available on select models for use in deep tanks. They are supplied in flanged sections and bolted together, making them ideal for limited lifting height.</p>
        <p>Contact your NOV sales representative for selection and size based on tank geometry for optimal mixing and suspension in each compartment.</p>
