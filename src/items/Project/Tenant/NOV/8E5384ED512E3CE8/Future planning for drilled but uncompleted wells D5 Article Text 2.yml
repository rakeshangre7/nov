        <p>By Q4 2020, only one out of five wells drilled will be completed. Rystad forecasts a 10% increase in DUCs contributed by publicly traded companies and a 16% increase by private operators.</p>
        <p>The first operation after DUCs are drilled, cemented, and left for months is toe-injection, which is done via a toe-valve or tubing-conveyed perforation. A toe-valve must be reliable as it is activated after months of being dormant in a well under high pressure, high temperature and reservoir fluid condition. NOV&rsquo;s Burst Port System&trade; (BPS&trade;) offers a reliable application for toe initiation for DUCs, and has proven its reliability after being left in multiple wells for more than 18 months. The BPS was pressure tested, activated and required flow rate was established for the subsequent plug and perf operation. Compared to other applications, such as a wet shoe sub or a traditional toe sleeve, the BPS offers higher reliability due to no moving parts, higher flow area, and a proven track record of opening months after the initial installation. </p>
