        <h2>The multi-purpose solution for maximum asset value</h2>
        <p>Whether used in drilling a high-temperature (HT) wildcat in a sensitive ecosystem or in a low-solids and nondamaging drill-in application, FluidControl&rsquo;s remarkably versatile TERRAFORM&trade; drilling fluid system is the single-drum solution that delivers nearly oil-based comparable drilling rates while generating the minimal to zero skin required for maximum production. With TERRAFORM, we&rsquo;ve even eliminated the parasite strings often required for the most reactive formations. All this is in addition to TERRAFORM&rsquo;s environmental benefits and reduced costs of a water-based drilling fluid.</p>
        <p>The core of TERRAFORM is the industry&rsquo;s only nonconcentrated biopolymer specially formulated to singularly push well beyond temperature boundaries once deemed impossible for a non-invert emulsion drilling fluid. TERRAFORM combines temperature stability up to 340 &deg;F with the superb inhibitive characteristics of potassium and the additional inhibition and lubrication of the formate. The result is a high-density, low-solids system that consistently exhibits dependable rheological profiles and eliminates the nonproductive time (NPT) spent dealing with an unstable wellbore. This is a multiuse system that also is minimally corrosive, extremely CO2 tolerant, nondamaging, easy to maintain, compatible with a wide range of fluids, and exhibits excellent suspension and lubricity characteristics.</p>
        <p>As an added bonus, TERRAFORM comes with the industry-leading expertise of FluidControl. As recognized TERRAFORM experts, we can modify the system to provide a cost-effective solution for any conceivable application.</p>
        <h2>A drilling fluid that takes &ldquo;green&rdquo; to an entirely new dimension </h2>
        <p>TERRAFORM contains no chlorides, making it entirely environmentally friendly and&mdash;as closed-bottle aerobic biodegradability tests confirm&mdash;completely biodegradable. </p>
        <p>Between reducing waste management expenses, eliminating parasite strings in highly reactive reservoirs, and rewriting days versus depth curves to slash well construction costs and increasing production, it&rsquo;s clear why more operators turn to TERRAFORM.  </p>
        <h2>In the most challenging applications, the results speak for themselves</h2>
        <p>In applications as diverse as building a high-angle curve to maximizing production in an unstable reservoir, TERRAFORM routinely reinforces its reputation as the high-performance workhorse of the drilling fluid industry.</p>
        <p>To learn more about the versatile TERRAFORM potassium formate drilling fluid system and how it can help meet all your drilling environmental and economic objectives, contact your FluidControl representative. </p>
