        <h2>Raise your rig to a higher standard and take on bigger jobs, deeper wells, and tougher terrains.</h2>
        <p>In an industry in which timing is everything, our upgrades enable you to stay one step ahead of the competition.</p>
        <h3>Offshore and onshore drilling rig upgrades</h3>
        <p>At NOV we purposefully design equipment and materials that move your business forward and outfit your rig fleet for more efficient, powerful, and consistent drilling performance. On land, our drilling rig upgrades include hydraulic upgrades for 7,500 psi conversion, a third mud pump, as well as VFD upgrades and a fourth genset. We also provide a torque pack that upgrades your NOV top drive and iron roughneck while increasing your setback capacity. Our offshore upgrade options include hookload, pipe handling, motion compensation, and a multitude of crane upgrades. Both our onshore and offshore drilling rig upgrades include upgrade capabilities to NOV controls through our NOVOS reflexive drilling system as well as health upgrades from our aftermarket services and support.</p>
        <h3>Field engineering support</h3>
        <p>The NOV Field Engineering team is a specialized group of mechanical, electrical, and controls engineers available to solve the most complex engineering requirements. Whether you are purchasing new drilling equipment or upgrading your existing equipment, the NOV Field Engineering team will support your unique requirements with in-depth OEM knowledge of your equipment. We have thousands of engineers supporting our Field Engineering teams around the globe to ensure we are providing the best solution to meet your specific requirements.</p>
