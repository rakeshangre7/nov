        <p>With our unrivaled experience in the design and delivery of monoethylene glycol (MEG) regeneration and reclamation units worldwide, we can provide an optimum solution to fit client- and field-specific needs. Our slip-stream and full-stream concepts have been extensively developed, tested, and operated, resulting in continuously improved products.</p>
        <p>We move efficiently from consultancy to design and supply of components and complete processing systems&mdash;including testing, qualification, and start-up.</p>
        <p>Our system optimization analysis for greenfield and brownfield projects is backed by more than 30 years of wellstream process research, development, and operational support. Our laboratory modeling techniques and computational fluid dynamics, for example, display how to achieve peak processing performance, while our MEG technology pilot plant can test equipment efficiency with actual field fluids and qualify candidate chemicals.</p>
        <p>We provide critically important feasibility studies, concept definitions, and front-end engineering design (FEED), enabling our customers to make sound decisions based on relevant cost and time considerations.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In addition to our consultancy, equipment delivery, and commissioning, start-up, and operational support, we also provide aftermarket services for our installed equipment, including maintenance, optimization, spare parts management, and user training.</p>
        <p>We offer a true end-to-end service in which every element reflects our superior expertise and commitment to perform. Through our products and services we enable maximum value at minimum cost to our customers.</p>
        <p>Through our expert understanding of field chemistry and the overall MEG loop, combined with our long experience with particle and corrosion product management, our solutions are particularly robust, offering high availability and low MEG losses. We have extensive knowledge of the impact of production chemicals and&mdash;through the use of our testing facilities&mdash;we are able to advise on their handling and clean-up with our MEG reclamation system. Our vast in-house technology portfolio enables us to bundle the MEG system with upstream hydrocarbon removal and downstream produced water treatment, offering a seamless route to meeting requirements while reducing weight, footprint, utilities, and cost.</p>
        <h2>Full-stream MEG regeneration systems</h2>
        <p>Our full-stream MEG regeneration systems treat the entire rich MEG feed for removal of salts, corrosion products, organic acids, and other impurities. The design produces a clean, lean MEG stream that reduces the risk of scaling in the subsea system. The combined reconcentration and reclamation process is performed under vacuum, minimizing energy consumption while avoiding thermal degradation conditions for MEG.</p>
        <p>Our design has been developed over 15 years to ensure reliability, efficient salt handling, and low MEG losses.</p>
        <h2>Slip-stream MEG regeneration systems</h2>
        <p>In this instance, the MEG is pretreated to remove hydrocarbons, low-soluble salts, and corrosion products before the water is removed through distillation. A slip stream of lean MEG is treated in a vacuum reclaimer to control the content of high-soluble salts.</p>
        <p>The slip-stream system design gives high reliability, operational flexibility, and low energy consumption in addition to efficient salt handling and low MEG losses. This concept enables the design of systems with very large capacities.</p>
        <h2>Advanced MEG</h2>
        <p>The advanced MEG systems combine full- and slip-stream processes with advanced technologies to improve handling and removal of hydrocarbons, organic acids, mercury, kinetic hydrate inhibitors, and other impurities from the closed MEG loop.</p>
        <h2>Conventional MEG</h2>
        <p>When no formation water&mdash;and hence no salt production&mdash;is expected from the reservoirs, conventional regeneration systems are used to distill the rich MEG feed and meet the required lean MEG concentration. Tie-ins can be prepared for retrofitting a slip-stream vacuum reclaimer for added flexibility and security.</p>
        <p>Our conventional MEG regeneration systems combine state-of-the-art technology with low costs and minimal footprint.</p>
