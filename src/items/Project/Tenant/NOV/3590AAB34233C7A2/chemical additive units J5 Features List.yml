        <h2>Truck-mounted chemical additive units</h2>
        <p>
        Our truck-mounted chemical additive units are ideal for small locations and rugged terrain and can be built on a wide variety of chassis. The units are typically equipped with up to seven chemical pumps. Customers frequently integrate these valuable units into frac spreads requiring fewer chemicals in tight locations.</p>
        <h2>Trailer-mounted chemical additive units</h2>
        <p>
        Our trailer-mounted chemical additive systems (CAS) have a high carrying and pumping capacity to meet the needs of today's larger fracturing jobs. The task of chemical control is greatly simplified with the use of an automated NOV CAS that allows the service company to pump chemicals accurately and problem free. The system incorporates off-the-shelf robust components designed for a harsh environment to help ensure reliable service throughout a long life, while its clean and simple design delivers high performance and minimal maintenance.</p>
