        <p>We base our solutions on modular equipment and flexible system designs that let you choose your vessel layout based on market demand. Thanks to years of combined expertise of serving the industry under the Norson, AmClyde, and Remacut brands, we offer a range of offshore pipe and cable laying solutions backed by a global support network.</p>
        <p>Our rigid and flexible lay systems range from small, modular bolt-on solutions that can be quickly mobilized on any vessel of opportunity up to large, specialized pipe laying vessels with integrated pipe carousel systems. As the market leader on large carousel systems, we use our extensive experience to create cost-efficient vessel adaptations that provide the offshore pipe lay system characteristics you need.</p>
        <h3>Lay system options</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Horizontal lay system:</strong> Can lay a single product or two products simultaneously in dual lay application; typically used for shallow-water lay operations</li>
            <li><strong>J-lay systems:</strong> Most commonly used for deepwater pipeline installation</li>
            <li><strong>Reel lay:</strong> Can be used to handle flexible pipe, rigid pipe, and umbilical</li>
            <li><strong>S-lay system:</strong> Most commonly used for laying concrete-coated thin-wall pipe in shallow water depths or thick-wall polymer-coated pipe in deep water</li>
            <li><strong>Vertical lay system:</strong> Simple and efficient method of deploying and recovering flexible flowlines, umbilicals, and power cables in a safe and environmentally friendly manner</li>
        </ul>
