      Value: "Unlike typical shell and tube heat exchangers, which have small-diameter tubes, our well test heaters consist of high-pressure pipe coils available in 5,000- and 10,000-psi working pressure. This design ensures a durable, robust heat exchanger that is resistant to plugging and fouling. Coils are designed and fabricated to meet applicable ASME codes and API standards. Low-pressure coils are available for heating applications in which lower operating pressures are encountered. Heat exchangers can be supplied complete with a steam generator unit when requested."

        <p>Our Kenics&trade; Static Mixer technology, available exclusively in our Kenics Heat Exchangers, offers the highest available coefficients for fast, uniform heat transfer. Capable of reliable operation in a wide range of process applications, including those in the polymer, plastic, and food and beverage industries, our Kenics Heat Exchangers require less space, less energy, and less residence time than standard designs.</p>
        <h2>Static mixing technology</h2>
        <p>Our Kenics Heat Exchanger consists of a continuous string of static mixer elements within each heat exchanger tube. The fluid flow is directed radially toward the pipe walls and back to the element, regardless of velocity. Additionally, momentum reversal and flow division also contribute to the mixing efficiency. All processed material is continuously and completely intermixed to eliminate radial gradients in temperature, velocity, and material composition. As a result, our Kenics Heat Exchangers provide predictable, controlled mixing and the most efficient form of thermal transfer available today.</p>
        <h2>Efficient heat exchanger design</h2>
        <p>By using our Kenics Static Mixer elements in each heat exchanger tube, the film buildup commonly associated with laminar flow empty tubes is significantly reduced. Process fluid is continuously pushed from the center of each tube to the wall and back to the center, eliminating thermal gradients and boosting the inside film coefficient.</p>
        <p>Kenics Static Mixer elements produce a more uniform, consistent transfer process, with three to seven times greater heat transfer rates than empty tubes alone. Other characteristics include the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Mixer elements create self-cleaning wiping action.</li>
        <li>Plug flow characteristics produce uniform heat history.</li>
        <li>Temperature gradients are blended out.</li>
        <li>Minimal fouling occurs.</li>
        <li>Surface renewal at tube wall reduces the chance of thermal degradation.</li>
        <li>Viscous materials can cool to near freezing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kenics Static Mixer elements are furnace-brazed to the pipe walls. The resultant enhanced surface area and internal fin effect augment the mixing action to dramatically enhance transfer rates. Removable elements are also available for applications requiring periodic cleaning during product changeovers.</p>
        <h2>Advanced design and fabrication</h2>
        <p>Our Kenics Heat Exchangers are custom-built in accordance with our customers' specifications. We can provide units designed to ASME code and TEMA requirements using state-of-the-art design tools for both engineering design and manufacturing. We understand that our heat exchanger units are often critical components in our customers' processes and that design and quality are essential. Beyond our expertise in both process and mechanical design, we take great pride in the products built by our experienced and certified welders. Our designs range from low pressure to more than 5,000 psi, and the design methods are backed by more than 40 years of installations.</p>
