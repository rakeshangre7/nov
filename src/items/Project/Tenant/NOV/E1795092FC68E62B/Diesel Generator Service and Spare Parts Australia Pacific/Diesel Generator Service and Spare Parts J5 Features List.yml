        <h2>Prime Power Servicing</h2>

Our trade-qualified field technicians are available 24/7/365 to ensure you remain operational day and night. Our service and repair methods are designed to reduce downtime with the added advantage of our huge hire fleet being available in the event of catastrophic failure.

Our workshop support also allows us to carry out engine overhauls, alternator rewinds, and general servicing of your entire fleet.</p>

        <h2>Standby Generator Servicing</h2>
        <p>Whether for hospitals, data centers, or sporting stadiums, standby generators are designed to work hard instantly and on demand. Chances of failure increase the longer generators are left dormant. Over time the quality of fuel and oils can deteriorate, and hoses and rubber seals can fail. Portable Power recommends that all standby generators are checked, started, and run every month to reduce failures and to catch any problems in a controlled environment. Portable Power can tailor a service package to coincide with your current operational requirements and your budget.</p>
        <p>Recommended service packages include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial site inspection</li>
            <li>Routine start, run, and comprehensive check with report </li>
            <li>Routine mains-failure testing </li>
            <li>Replacing oil, air, fuel, and water filters </li>

        <p><strong>Simulated Mains-Fail Testing: Is your standby generator &rdquo;storm ready?&rdquo; </strong></p>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t get caught in the dark. Start failures are often caused by automatic transfer switch faults. </p>
        <p>Simulated mains-fail testing allows you to test your transfer system in a controlled environment and ensures that your generator will start automatically when needed. This test also includes a comprehensive check over your generator and a written report on completion. It may have been years since your last power outage. Is your transfer system still serviceable? </p>
