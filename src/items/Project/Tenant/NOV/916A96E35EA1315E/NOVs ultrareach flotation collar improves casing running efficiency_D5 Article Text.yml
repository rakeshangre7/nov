        <p>Another method to address these issues is to place a buoyancy barrier within the casing string to trap lighter fluid in the horizontal section and reduce friction. This proven solution, which frequently uses a bursting ceramic disc, improves casing running efficiency, but also requires specialized equipment to catch the additional debris from ruptured disc. Additionally, landing sub equipment may also be required. To combat these operational challenges, we deploy an innovative new ultra-reach flotation collar (URFC) that incorporates an embedded glass barrier. The glass barrier ruptures more easily than the ceramic one, and the smaller particles that can be pumped through standard float equipment without risk of damage.</p>
        <p>To learn more about our URFC and how we&rsquo;re using the tool to help companies around the world improve casing running times and reach target depth more efficiently, read our feature article in the <a href="-/media/d9af9c3ce9b0428dbda1680c37e8e647.ashx">July edition of World Oil</a>&nbsp;magazine.</p>
