        <p>Our Rottweiler frac plugs are the shortest on the market but still offer optimum performance during fracturing operations. Rottweiler frac plugs are compact and large bore and can be pumped in at high displacement rates, hold high differential pressure, and are easily milled. Additionally, Rottweiler frac plugs are the only products to offer a built-in chemical tracer that provides real-time data on reservoir characteristics during frac jobs to enhance production. Rottweiler frac plugs are currently available in fully composite or in composite with metal slips. Dissolvable and metal plug versions are expected to be released in the near future.</p>

        <p>Our Rottweiler&trade; frac plugs are designed for plug-and-perf multistage fracturing wellbores. The large ID increases flow and reduces the risk of bridging, while the design provides fast mill-out with less debris to remove from the well.</p>
        <p>Though&nbsp;the shortest frac plugs on the market, they still offer optimum performance during fracturing operations. Rottweiler frac plugs are compact and large in bore, and they can be pumped in at high displacement rates, hold high differential pressure, and are easily milled.

        <p>Our Rottweiler&trade; frac plugs are designed for plug-and-perf multistage fracturing wellbores. The large ID increases flow and reduces the risk of bridging, while the design provides fast mill-out with less debris to remove from the well.</p>
        <p>Though&nbsp;the shortest frac plugs on the market, they still offer optimum performance during fracturing operations. Rottweiler frac plugs are compact and large in bore, and they can be pumped in at high displacement rates, hold high differential pressure, and are easily milled. Additionally, Rottweiler frac plugs are the only products to offer a built-in chemical tracer that provides real-time data on reservoir characteristics during frac jobs to enhance production. Rottweiler frac plugs are currently available in fully composite or in composite with metal slips.</p>
