        <h2>Reduce wear and protect your investment with a trusted brand</h2>
        <p>Accurate sucker rod guide selection, material, and placement is crucial to ensure effective wear prevention in production tubing and sucker rods. Employing correct wear mitigation techniques improves well productivity and extends asset life, which means less downtime and more expenses saved. With the most comprehensive portfolio of sucker rod guide technology available, our New Era&trade; guides are purposefully built to maximize your operations in the most diverse and difficult production environments.</p>
        <p>Wellbore deviations, dynamometer readings, workover histories, well operating conditions, completion information, and production data must be taken into consideration for the proper rod guide design, materials, and spacing for each well.</p>
        <p>Proper sucker rod guide selection can ensure effective wear prevention and extend the life of your rod and tubing string</p>
        <p>Manufactured from a complete line of engineered plastics and enhanced with performance additives, our products can be tailored to any operation. As a leading artificial lift company, we are able to offer our rod guides in any material, including Nylon, PPA, PPS, and fiberglass sucker rods, so we can match your performance needs for any drill string environment.</p>
        <h2>Additional sucker rod guide services</h2>
        <p>In addition to our products, we also offer on-site field support, an in-house laboratory for testing materials, and an in-house quality department that monitors each facility and manufacturing process&mdash;all to ensure you receive the highest level of quality and service.</p>
