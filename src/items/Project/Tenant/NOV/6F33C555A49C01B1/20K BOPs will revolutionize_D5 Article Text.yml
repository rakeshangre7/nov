        <p>"This is a historic moment for the offshore oil and gas industry,” commented Joe Rovig, President, NOV Rig Technologies. “The introduction of NOV's 20K BOP marks a new era in the exploration and development of high-pressure formations. We are proud of our role in enabling our industry to continually push beyond traditional limitations through technological innovation."</p>
        
        <p>"The sale of this equipment and technology package is the culmination of 5 years of extensive work by our Rig Technologies segment and marks another advancement for the offshore industry as it seeks to safely and efficiently drill the world's most challenging reservoirs. The 20K BOP stack is designed for use with extremely high-pressure reservoirs and can be used in ultradeepwater applications. The initial deployment is expected in 2021 on a 20K well in the Gulf of Mexico."</p>
