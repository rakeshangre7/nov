        <p>The Grant Prideco&trade; eXtreme&trade; Torque (XT&trade;) connection is a high-performance rotary-shouldered connection available for pipe sizes from 2⅜ to 6⅝ in. Incorporating a second-generation double-shouldered design with a proprietary thread profile, these connections provide improved hydraulics and more torque than connections of comparable dimensions. XT connections often enable the use of larger drill pipe for a given hole size while maintaining fishability, and they serve as the market reference for deepwater and extended reach drilling.</p>
        <h2>Proprietary thread profile</h2>
        <p>XT connections have a proprietary thread design with a larger root radius to maintain greater fatigue resistance than American Petroleum Institute (API) connections, even at increased operational torque. Cold-rolled threads further enhance their ability to resist fatigue.</p>
        <h2>Torque optimized</h2>
        <p>The XT connection is designed to deliver a higher torque rating than first-generation double-shouldered connections. Even in a more streamlined configuration, XT provides 70% more torque than API connections of comparable dimensions. This additional strength meets the required torque for drilling extended reach or in more performance-demanding environments.</p>
        <h2>Streamlined for performance</h2>
        <p>The XT connection&rsquo;s increased torsional strength enables tool joint dimensional optimization that is more aligned with the pipe body torsional strength. It can be configured with a smaller OD and larger ID without sacrificing torsional capacity, which contributes to improved drill string hydraulics. XT connections facilitate the use of larger drill pipe in a set hole size, such as 5⅞ in. drill pipe with XT 57 in an 8&frac12; in. hole size. This provides improved hydraulic efficiency, better hole cleaning, and greater buckling strength without compromising torsional strength or fishability.</p>
