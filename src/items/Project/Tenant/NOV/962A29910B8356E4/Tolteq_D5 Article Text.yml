        <p>A client operating in Garvin County, Oklahoma, was faced with the challenge of obtaining reliable real-time MWD data in a harsh buildup section of a well. They sought out our Tolteq™ top-mount pulser (TMP) for the job due to the use of high flow rates, high low-gravity solids, and the need to pump large quantities of cottonseed and cedar fiber lost-circulation material (LCM).</p>
        <p>The client used our 6.50-in. TMP to drill 3,100 ft across 275 downhole hours at an average flowrate of 570 GPM to a maximum depth of more than 13,300-ft MD/10,900-ft TVC. The TMP delivered reliable pulses across the run, with a single pulser operating for 250 hours without any issues. </p>
