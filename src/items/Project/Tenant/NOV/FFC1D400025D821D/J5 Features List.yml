        <p>The NP-200 high-pressure pumps are specifically designed to deliver high flow rates at high pressure while providing exceptional low flow rate turndown.<br />
        <br />
        The NP-200 triplex nitrogen pump is designed for durability. Low-friction roller and ball bearings are used rather than common journal bearings. This significantly enhances durability, particularly at low speeds at which journal bearings are most vulnerable.<br />
        <br />
        The design also operates at a wider temperature range and produces less heat in the bearings. This means less lube oil system requirements for preheating and cooling the lube oil.<br />
        <br />
        The welded steel case design enables strength where it is needed while reducing excess weight. Steel construction gives ductility and enables repairs if damaged. This design is compact in size for minimal footprint when installed. Typical hydraulic drive packaging enhances flexible installation of the nitrogen pump without drive shafts to align.<br />
        <br />
        Many cold-end brands may be mounted to the NP-200 pump for flexibility in use.</p>

        <p>Our NP-400 pump satisfies the market requirement for high-pressure pumping rates up to 467,000 SCFH.<br />
        <br />
        The NP-400 pump is a medium-rate version of the NP-1000 pump that has proven its durability for years. This new design approach uses low-friction roller bearings rather than journal bearings to significantly enhance durability&mdash;particularly at low speeds at which other pumps using journal bearings are most vulnerable. The NP-400 design also operates at a much cooler temperature.<br />
        <br />
        This pump has a simplified design and is internally balanced on each cylinder for smooth pumping operation. The maximum rod load is 42,000 lbs, enabling 15,000 psi working pressure at rates up to 324,000 SCFH.</p>
