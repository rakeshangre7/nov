        <p style="color: #000000;">Our LDSU silos come complete with one 5-in. victaulic nipple with a butterfly valve and union attached for inlet; one 5-in. victaulic nipple with a butterfly valve and union attached for vent; one 5-in. victaulic nipple for discharge with a butterfly valve and union attached; one 2-in., 3,000-lb coupling with pressure relief in the vent line; one 20-in. hinged manway in shell with an access ladder; one 1.5-in., 3,000-lb coupling in the top head with the gauge line viewable from ground level; and an aeration system with inlet manifold.</p>
        <p style="color: #000000;">The aeration system includes four aeration cartridges and four aeration jets in cone. The aeration manifold comprises 3-in. pipe with a 2-in. inlet with union, butterfly valves for air control, and required check valves. A skid base with appropriate support saddles will be installed under the full length of the tank and at the tank base. This system also includes sandblasting and application of four-coat marine service paint systems with zinc primer and single-color top coat.</p>
