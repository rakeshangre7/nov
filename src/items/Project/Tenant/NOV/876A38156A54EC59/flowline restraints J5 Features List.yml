        <p>Our flowline restraint system is a safety device designed to reduce separation between lengths of temporary pipework in the event of a pressurized pipeline rupture. The system consists of just two parts: high-strength polyester restraints and steel shackles. It is designed for easy installation, leaving a cleaner finish and look. </p>
        <p>Anson&trade; flowline restraints are designed for use on pressurized temporary pipework, offering an additional level of protection for employees and equipment by reducing the movement of the flowline in the event of a rupture. The system is designed to cover a wide range of pipe sizes and pressures; the Series 1 system covers smaller pipe-bore diameter and lower pressures, while the Series 2 system covers larger-bore pipework and higher pressures.</p>
