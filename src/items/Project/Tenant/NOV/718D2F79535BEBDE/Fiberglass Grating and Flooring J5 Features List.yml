        <p>Our phenolic, pultruded FRP gratings are designed to withstand harsh corrosive environments. High performance and open mesh grating, ideal for medium to heavy duty use in a wide range of applications, such as marine vessels, offshore platforms, and frequently used for pedestrian areas and larger loads, including vehicle traffic. Much stronger than moulded grating by design, pultruded gratings can carry higher loads with significantly less deflection. FRP grating is lightweight, typically 1/3 the weight of steel grating equivalent, yet extremely robust and impact resistant.</p>
        <p>Benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Proven over 17 years use offshore</li>
            <li>Meets BS 4592 Parts 0,4 and 6</li>
            <li>Meets USCG PFM 2-98 Level 2, Lloyds, BV, DNV and ABS Approvals</li>
            <li>Highly corrosion resistant</li>
            <li>Higher load capacity than equivalent steel grating</li>
            <li>Proven wheel load and impact capability</li>
            <li>Ideal for field fabrication &ndash; no edge banding required</li>
            <li>Lightweight &ndash; typically 1/3 the weight of steel equivalent</li>
            <li>Much stronger and tougher than moulded grating by design</li>
            <li>Designed to withstand harsh, corrosive environments</li>
            <li>Ideal replacement for aluminium or steel gratings</li>
        </ul>
