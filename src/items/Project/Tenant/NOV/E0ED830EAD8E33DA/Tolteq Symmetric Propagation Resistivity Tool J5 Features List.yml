        The Tolteq&trade; symmetric propagation resistivity (SPR) tool offers real-time logging while drilling (LWD) resistivity combined with advanced, high-bandwidth measurement while drilling (MWD) tools. The tool creates high-quality resistivity logs with both phase and attenuation measurements in real time&mdash;measurement capabilities as well as multiple depths of investigation and vertical resolutions help with the drilling process. With a total of eight curves recorded into memory, the SPR tool has extremely high-resolution memory data with fast data dump capability. This feature enables our field operators to create high-resolution logs after the run is complete with no impact on drilling time. <br />
        <br />
        The SPR tool was designed and engineered around the concept of borehole compensation with a symmetric configuration of transmitters and receivers. This reduces the artefacts on the log due to borehole rugosity while minimizing errors caused by drifts in electronic circuits&mdash;the bed boundaries are better delineated with the symmetric design. <br />
