        <p>The Ameron&trade; MPBR is a 60- to 90-minute pole butt replacement for ground-decayed wood, relocations, grade changes, and car-hit poles. Your new pole is ready in minutes, and all lines remain fully energized.<br />
        <br />
        The MPBR concept is a "splice-repair" method. The damaged lower section of the pole is replaced with a sturdy concrete modular base, and the entire upper section is simply transferred to the new base and secured with a quick setting grout. The top section of the pole is left intact, meaning all lines and equipment remain fully energized during the process. Standard pole replacement equipment is used.<br />
        <br />
        Each module consists of two simple parts: the tapered, prestressed spun-cast concrete module and a galvanized steel connector for joining the intact top section of the pole to its new concrete base. High-structural-strength concrete modules provide original pole strength in all directions with safety, economy, and ease of installation.</p>
