        <p>Since it was introduced to the utility market in 2008, the uPole™ has been accepted on standards with over 100 municipalities, IOUs, and electric cooperatives, and the list is growing.</p>
        <p>Our sand-hardened utility pole is manufactured using Fiberglass-Reinforced Plastic (FRP) materials. FRP is resistant to all known mechanisms of degradation.</p>
        <p>The strength and durability of the uPole provides dependable and cost-effective defence against weather-related threats to an electric utility’s ability to deliver power to its customers.</p>
        <p><strong>Fire Testing Report</strong></p>
        <p>Our uPole received an "A" fire rating in an independent fire rating test related to wildfire exposure. Read the full report here.</p>
