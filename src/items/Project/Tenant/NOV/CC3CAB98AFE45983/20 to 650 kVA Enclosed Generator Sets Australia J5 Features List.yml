        <p>The Portable Power enclosed generator sets are specifically designed to meet Australian standards for sound attenuation at 7 m. The heavy-duty galvanized and powder-coated canopies are designed with sound insulation to the internals to achieve maximum sound attenuation without interference with the air flow. Designed to be easily transported and moved on site with great efficiency, the Portable Power Rental Spec is the only option for reliable and efficient power needs.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits/Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built to comply with ISO3046, ISO8525, and ISO8525-3-5-6</li>
            <li>Sound-attenuated, heavy-duty, galvanised and powder-coated Steel Canopies</li>
            <li>Oversized, fully bunded, skid-mounted diesel fuel tanks</li>
            <li>Remote fuel valves for easy remote fuel tank connection to increase refilling intervals</li>
            <li>State-of-the-art PLC controllers with GUI and remote monitoring capabilities</li>
            <li>RCD electrical protection on all units</li>
            <li>Single-point center lift and forklift pockets for versatile movability</li>
            <li>Large range of sizes and availability from 20 to 650 kVA</li>
            <li>Synchronizing facilities for simple redundancy and increased flexibility to meet your exact power needs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The enclosed canopied sets range from 20 to 650 kVA and are designed to achieve high ambient operation at minimum decibel rating for commercial use. Portable Power generators are engineered to international standards.</p>
