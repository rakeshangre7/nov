      Value: "<p>As an ideal pump for either intermittent or continuous dosing duties in high-pressure, low-flow applications, and the dosing/meting pump represents a cost-effective and reliable alternative to the more expensive gear pumps traditionally used for these types of duties. Manufactured to ISO 9001:2008 quality assurance standards, the modular design of the new dosing pump enables the four models in the range to cover performance requirements from 5 to 1,250 L/hr and 72 bar pressure. The dosing/metering pumps provide a smooth pumping action with no pulsation and very low shear, and they are ideal for either intermittent or continuous duties.</p>"
