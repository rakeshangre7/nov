        <h2>Case Study: Rocky Mountain Operator</h2>
        <p>An 80-year-old field in Wyoming produces 2,500- to 2,800 barrels of oil per dayBOPD. Water production has steadily increased each year, and today the field produces more than 90 barrels of water for every barrel of oil produced—a water cut of almost 99% percent. Our system was delivered and installed in May 2014 for 18 weeks from May to September. The WaterWolf system recovered an additional 4 barrels of oil from every 10,000 barrels of water treated—an additional 100 BOPD for the field. Read more here.</p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Recovered an additional 1 to 4 barrels of oil from every 10,000 barrels of water produced. For Spring Creek, this equates to an additional 25 to 100 BOPD. The WaterWolf system proved a range of positive results.</li>
            <li>Eliminated H2S and CO2 emissions. The dynamic, closed-loop process eliminated air -polluting emissions and associated flaring requirements.</li>
            <li>Reduced costs to less than $US 0.01 per barrel of produced water. Because the WaterWolf system eliminates the need for costly chemicals, the treatment costs were significantly lowered.</li>
            <li>Eliminated excess tanks. The use of our skid-mounted system dramatically reduced the footprint of water treatment and handling process, because skim tanks were no longer needed.</li>
            <li>Reduced costs and risks of dealing with associated waste. With the WaterWolf's single-stage technology, solids were removed separately from the oil, eliminating oily sludge to be stored and transported off- site. The technology eliminated costly and hazardous tank cleanouts to remove accumulated tank-bottoms solids.<br />
