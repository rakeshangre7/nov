The compensating force is determined by the magnitude of the system pressure, or weight on hook. As the drilling vessel heaves upward from wave action, the hook load moves downward and the compensator cylinder is extended. While this hook motion is relative to the drilling vessel, it is fixed relative to the sea floor.</p>"
