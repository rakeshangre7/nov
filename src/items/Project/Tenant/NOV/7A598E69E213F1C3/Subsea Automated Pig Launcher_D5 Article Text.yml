        <p>We invite you to join us at the awards ceremony on May 6, 2019, at 1600 hours in the NRG Center Rotunda Lobby where NOV representatives will be accepting an award for our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=527CFA5A73F94C82AD2591D399E60A56&amp;_z=z">Subsea Automated Pig Launcher</a>&nbsp;(SAPL).</p>
        <p>The SAPL allows pig launching from the subsea to topside and promises flexible and robust technology that enables a wide range of pigging operations. The system eliminates the need for a second flowline solely for pigging and wax handling. It has also proven to reduce the number of days required for vessel mobilization compared to conventional subsea pigging systems. The automated pig launcher encourages frequent pigging that can help avoid pipeline blockages, production shutdowns, and improve the integrity level. With the SAPL, you can pig any time on demand from the control room.</p>
