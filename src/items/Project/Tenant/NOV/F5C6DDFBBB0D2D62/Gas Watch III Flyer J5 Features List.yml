        <p>Built on NOV-patented technology, the Gas Watch&trade; III dual infrared system measures both methane (C1) and propane (C3) gases. Unaffected by oil-based mud, the Gas Watch III system measures only formation gasses, accurately pinpointing gas shows and their magnitude. Calculating the C1/C3 ratio can provide a valuable tool in identifying hydrocarbon characteristics, which aid in geosteering and reservoir characterization. Solid-state sensors eliminate the need for field calibration and are guaranteed for five years.</p>
        <p>The new QGM trap's enhanced sampling function guarantees accurate air-to-gas mixture, which is critical in gas-ratio analysis and minimizes the effects of changing mud levels. Our new design eliminates motor seizure due to corrosive liquids and allows quick and easy maintenance, resulting in maximum uptime.</p>
        <p>You can track all gas readings on the rig in conjunction with your normal RigSense&trade;  Electronic Drilling Recorder (EDR) and access your data though the WellData&trade; information system.</p>
