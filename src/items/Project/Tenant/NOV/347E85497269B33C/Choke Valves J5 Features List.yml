        <p>Choke valves are used to control flow rate and reduce pressure for processing of produced fluids farther downstream. Our Anson™ choke valves are offered in two basic body styles (adjustable and positive) and three body types (AH2, AD2, and AR2).&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Anson choke valves have interchangeable bodies. The bonnet can be removed on the adjustable valve and replaced with the positive choke valve bonnet, and vice versa. In most cases users will determine the desired calibrated orifice size using the adjustable valve and then convert this to the positive valve with the corresponding choke bean in place.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Adjustable choke valve&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>The Anson adjustable choke valve is manually operated via a handwheel. This is a stem and seat design, with the desired flow rate achieved by turning the handwheel to achieve a calibrated orifice size. The orifice size is visible on a sleeve located above the valve bonnet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        </p>
        <h2>
        Positive choke valve&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>An Anson positive choke valve uses a choke bean to provide a fixed flow rate. This valve has no manual means of operation. The choke beans are supplied separately and are measured in orifice sizes of 64ths of an inch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The AH2 is the most widely used within the field, available in 1- and 2-in. maximum orifice sizes. The AH2 valves can be supplied with either Anson hammer union ends (standard or sour service) or API 6A flanged connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The AD2 is a &frac34;-in. orifice valve, normally supplied with Figure 1502 union end connections. The AD2M is identical in valve design to the AD2 but has nonstandard leg lengths that allow it to be used as a direct replacement for valves in existing choke manifold assemblies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The AR2 is a &frac34;-in. orifice valve developed for a maximum working pressure of 6,000 psi, with Figure 602 union end connections.&nbsp;</li>

        <p>Choke valves are used to control flow rate and reduce pressure for processing of produced fluids farther downstream. Effective chokes reduce the likelihood of damage to downstream equipment, support longer lasting production timespans, and alleviate stress from field operators by keeping them away from the wellhead.</p>
        <p>Designed with durability and performance for the most difficult applications imaginable, our production chokes rise to the challenge by offering superior controllability and increased operator uptime. Our chokes are also economical and provide the lowest total cost of ownership in the industry. As a global manufacturer and supplier of chokes for the oil and gas production market, we can provide a fit-for-purpose solution for any application.</p>
        <p>Selecting the proper trim for your application and environment is crucial and can help avoid expensive damage such as erosion and corrosion. We offer the following geometries:</p>
        <h2>External sleeve</h2>
        <p>With its proprietary annulus, our external sleeve trim enables an effective impingement process that efficiently dissipates energy and reduces velocity using the latest in fluid-management dynamics.</p>
        <p>The use of micron-grade carbide and proven binding agents provides durability, controllability, and repeatability to best support your well management program even when faced with &ldquo;sand producers.&rdquo;</p>
        <h2>Plug and cage</h2>
        <p>Our plug and cage trim is frequently used when high flow and controllability are needed for injection or conventional oil and gas production. Features include submicron grade carbide, metal bonnet seal, threadless body, fully guided cage trim, and high Cv capacity.</p>
        <h2>Multi-stage stacked disc</h2>
        <p>Our stacked disc is designed with a semi-circular porting pattern that offers longer wear life. These chokes are primarily used for two types of service:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Very high pressure drops with the risk of cavitation</li>
        <li>High pressure gas service for noise abatement</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Intermeter trim</h2>
        <p>Intermittent trim synchronizes with artificial lift which gives operators the ability to use choke body in service and convert it to handle gas lift applications without in-line removal of choke body or replacing with another value type.</p>
        <h2>Dual stage low flow</h2>
        <p>Our dual stage low flow trim is used with methanol and ethylene glycol (MEG) injection or service applications. This trim functions well in specialized service with very high temperatures.</p>
        <h2>Needle and seat</h2>
        <p>Within the adjustable style of choke, needle and seat trim is the most economical option for well control. Selected for applications with tight gas and oil and low-pressure production, needle and seat trim also has the lowest ability to control pressure and flow compared to other style trim designs.</p>
        <h2>Bean and caged bean</h2>
        <p>Our most economical offering for only positive style chokes, bean and caged bean trim is used for static pressure control with the bean often used to create back pressure and the caged bean performing well during high pressure drops.</p>
