        <p>The advanced performance capabilities of Dualoy 3000/LCX offer a substantial cost benefit and, most importantly, meet safety and compliance needs. The unique coaxial construction of Dualoy 3000/LCX offers many features and makes this fiberglass pipe the best value in corrosion-resistant piping solutions. High strength and stiffness make Dualoy 3000/LCX virtually indestructible, offering predictable and reliable performance. Its compact design allows less trenching and takes less warehouse space.</p>
        <p>Fiber Glass Systems is the market leader for underground fuel piping systems, with almost 50 years of continuous supply of UL-listed products. Dualoy 3000LCX piping is reliable and has never been removed because of fuel incompatibility; thus, there are no reinstall costs. Our products are designed to meet governmental environmental regulations, including those of the EPA.</p>

        <p>The advanced performance capabilities of Dualoy 3000/LCX offer a substantial cost benefit and, most importantly, meet safety and compliance needs. The unique coaxial construction of Dualoy 3000/LCX offers many features and makes this fiberglass pipe the best value in corrosion-resistant piping solutions. High strength and stiffness make Dualoy 3000/LCX virtually indestructible, offering predictable and reliable performance. Its compact design allows less trenching and takes less warehouse space.</p>
        <p>Fiber Glass Systems is the market leader for underground fuel piping systems, with almost 50 years of continuous supply of UL-listed products. Dualoy 3000LCX piping is reliable and has never been removed because of fuel incompatibility; thus, there are no reinstall costs. Our products are designed to meet governmental environmental regulations, including those of the EPA.</p>
        <h2>In-series piping</h2>
        <p>The coaxial design makes it easy for through-the-sump piping, saving installation cost and time.</p>
        <h2>Leak prevention</h2>
        <p>UL 971 bonded sump entry fittings provide positive seal at the sump, preventing leaking of underground fuel in or out of the sump. Our Bonded Sump Entry Fitting &ndash; Termination Style also provides Class I protection, which complies with California&rsquo;s requirement for continuous interstitial monitoring of the piping systems' secondary containment.</p>
        <h2>StationWare 3000</h2>
        <p>StationWare 3000 is a standalone CAD program that will provide a professional-looking station layout drawing and an accurate bill of materials for the site.</p>
