        <h2>Protect personnel and surrounding area from pressurized fluid</h2>
        
        <p>Designed to protect against overpressure events during fracturing operations, our frac protection system (FPS) relieves the fracturing fluid into a tank, protecting personnel and the surrounding area from the pressurized fluid and releasing directly to the atmosphere.</p>
        
        <p>The FPS skid includes a manifold section, relief tank, hydraulic power unit, and control system. This unique system is modular and can be configured with a 72-bbl flowback tank or without, decreasing the skid size by roughly half.</p>
        
        <p>During fracturing&nbsp;operations, the FPS is connected to the main treatment line and a signal from the FPS skid control system or the customer’s data van will trigger the relief valve in case of overpressurization in the line.</p>
        
        <p>Our relief valve will open the instant an overpressure event has occurred, and up to three pressure transducers will be monitoring working pressure every 20 milliseconds upstream from the FPS. The controls system will email a report every time an overpressure event occurs, and overpressure relief points can be set locally or remotely while the FPS is in service.</p>

        <h3>Versatile design, allowing fit-for-purpose utilization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tankless FPS</strong>:&nbsp;With the 72-bbl storage tank removed, this option reduces the footprint by approximately 45% while still maintaining all the benefits from the full-sized FPS. Discharge from the FPS can be routed to a discharge tank via a 3-in. 1502 connection on the FPS.&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong>Compact FPS</strong>:&nbsp;In this design, the 72-bbl tank and the main treatment and test isolation valves have been removed while still retaining the redundancy of the two relief valves installed in series. This option offers a 55% reduction in footprint compared to the full system while maintaining the FPS&rsquo;s core functionality, ensuring reliable and repeatable operations.</li>
