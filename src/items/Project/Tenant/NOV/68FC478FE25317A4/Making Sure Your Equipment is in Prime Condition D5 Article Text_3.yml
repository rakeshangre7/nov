        <p>The PRIME survey assesses every component and function within the rig-owned solids control and drilling waste management package, including shakers, mud-mixing systems, gas separation, piping evaluation, friction-loss evaluation, hydrocyclone pressures, pit room, shake house, screen stock, and spare stock.</p>
        <p>In a matrix, NOV assigns this equipment condition-based color codes: green for good, yellow for minor issues, and red for major issues. This makes it easier for the drilling contractor to identify what demands immediate attention while prioritizing repairs and replacements. At the end of the process, a certificate is issued to drilling contractors whose rigs are in good condition stating no changes are required or that the repairs have been completed within recommendations.</p>
