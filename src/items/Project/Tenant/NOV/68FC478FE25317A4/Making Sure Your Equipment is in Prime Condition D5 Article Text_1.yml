      Value: <p>The PRIME&trade; inspection service informs drilling contractors well in advance what equipment needs to be repaired, replaced, or upgraded in order to ensure solids control and waste management packages operate reliably and efficiently. Undertaking such efforts allows equipment to be ready to deploy the moment the rig arrives at the shipyard, giving customers a head start on new part order deliveries that can take as long as 8 to 10 weeks.</p>
