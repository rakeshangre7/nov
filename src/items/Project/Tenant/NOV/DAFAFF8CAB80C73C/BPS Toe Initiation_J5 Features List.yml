        <p>Traditionally, tubing-conveyed perforation guns have been the necessary means of gaining access to the formation at the toe of a horizontal well for stimulation purposes. This perforating method requires expensive setup and complicated operations to achieve what our BPS technology can accomplish at a fraction of the cost, without tubing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The BPS uses pressure-activated ports to create a conduit from the wellbore to the formation face. BPS collars contain predrilled holes covered by burst plates designed to open at a predetermined pressure. These collars are integrated into the production casing and are typically cemented in place. The BPS ports are opened by pressurizing the wellbore at surface.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>BPS &ndash; Toe Fracturing&nbsp;<br />
        Multiple BPS collars can be installed throughout the toe section with predetermined spacing, resulting in the stimulation equivalent of multiple perforation clusters across the interval. To ensure all BPS ports are open, bio balls can be pumped from the surface to seal off the open ports in the collar. This allows for a subsequent pressure increase to rupture the remaining ports in all collars throughout the interval.</p>

        <p>Traditionally, tubing-conveyed perforation guns have been the necessary means of gaining access to the formation at the toe of a horizontal well for stimulation purposes. This perforating method requires expensive setup and complicated operations to achieve what our BPS&trade; technology can accomplish at a fraction of the cost, without tubing.</p>
        <p>The BPS uses pressure-activated ports to create a conduit from the wellbore to the formation face. BPS collars contain predrilled holes covered by burst plates designed to open at a predetermined pressure. These collars are integrated into the production casing and are typically cemented in place. The BPS ports are opened by pressurizing the wellbore at surface.</p>
        <h2>BPS &ndash; Toe fracturing</h2>
        Multiple BPS collars can be installed throughout the toe section with predetermined spacing, resulting in the stimulation equivalent of multiple perforation clusters across the interval. To ensure all BPS ports are open, bio balls can be pumped from the surface to seal off the open ports in the collar. This allows for a subsequent pressure increase to rupture the remaining ports in all collars throughout the interval.
