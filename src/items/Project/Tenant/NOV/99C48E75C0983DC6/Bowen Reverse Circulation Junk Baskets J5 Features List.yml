        <p>The Bowen™ reverse circulation junk basket aids in retrieval of small junk objects inside the wellbore. This tool's unique principle of reverse circulation ensures complete recovery of all junk and eliminates misruns. A drain through the tool also eliminates the possibility of pulling a wet string. In addition, it may be converted into an effective fishing magnet and still retain the reverse circulation feature.</p>
        <p>A single junk catcher is used in each assembly. A lifting sub provides ease of handling and includes a storage space for the steel ball used in the operation of the tool. It may be converted into a fishing magnet by replacing the catcher with the Bowen magnet insert.</p>
        <p>Type B and Type C alternative shoes are available. The Type B shoe is similar in design to Type A but dressed with Itcoloy. The Type C is flat bottomed and dressed with Itcoloy.</p>
        <p>During operation, with the steel ball dropped into the valve seat, fluid flows through the inner passage of the barrel and out the vents in its lower end. The fluid is directed outward and downward and deflected toward the center. Fluid flows in a continuous stream to the center of the tool and up through return ports in the upper end of the barrel. All junk is thus carried into the barrel above the junk catcher.</p>
