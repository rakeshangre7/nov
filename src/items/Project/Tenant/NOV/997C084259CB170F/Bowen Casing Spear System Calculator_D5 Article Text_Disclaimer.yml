        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Calculated values are theoretical yield strengths and are considered accurate to within &plusmn;20%. They assume the worst-case scenario based on API tolerance. All strengths assume straight and steady pulling of a fully engaged round fish. Any irregularities in the fish ID/OD, damage to the grapple or mandrel, or jarring can reduce the strength substantially. Ratings are based only on grapple range. These values are presented without any safety factor. Please contact <a href="mailto:wt-bowentools@nov.com">NOV Engineering</a> if there are any questions.</p>
