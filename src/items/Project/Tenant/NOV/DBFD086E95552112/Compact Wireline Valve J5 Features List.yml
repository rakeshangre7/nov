        <p>Safety, reliability, and serviceability are the critical design principals we use to keep your team safe on the wellsite and keep your costs of ownership low.
        </p>
        <p>Our wireline valve provides positive barrier protection during well service operations, providing sealing and/or shearing functions when running slickline, braided wireline, or electric line.
        </p>
        <p>The Elmar&trade; original compact wireline valve has been in service for more than 25 years. It enables you to minimize your costs by using a reliable and robust valve that is designed to be easily serviced.  Our track record and operational experience are backed up by independent third-party approval for every wireline valve we make, meaning you can depend on your wireline valve when you need it most.
        </p>
        <p>Reliability is designed into every compact wireline valve through a detailed engineering design focused on operational simplicity, a minimum number of components, and using standard elastomers to ensure it is easily available around the world. The mono-block forged construction of the main body improves pressure integrity and further reduces servicing cost, with fewer well pressure-retaining seals and potential leak points.
        </p>
        <p>It is available as standard in single, dual, triple, or quad ram configurations, and in a full range of sizes and working pressures from 2&frac12;- to 9-in. bore sizes, and 5,000- to 20,000-psi working pressures. Materials can be specified to suit your well conditions and connections to suit your wellhead. Custom sizes are available on request to suit your operations.</p>
