        <p>Manufactured in stainless steel and with the attention to detail applied to the screens, the BRANDT Swarf Screen System provides a versatile, cost-effective, clean, safe, and hassle-free option for removing swarf at the flowline.&nbsp;Available for both the BRANDT AX series of shakers and for the BRANDT VSM 300&trade;, the swarf screens simply replace the original screen panels, so no equipment modification is necessary.</p>
        <p>The unique AX and AX300PLUS swarf screens offer the only in-shaker removal solutions on the market&mdash;transforming a shale shaker into an efficient swarf removal tool.</p>
        <p>Each batch can be tailor made to maximize throughput based on expected swarf specifications.</p>
        <h2>Features/Benefits</h2>
        <p><strong>Plate design: </strong>A laser-cut stainless-steel plate ensures a slick finish, reducing the likelihood of birds&rsquo; nests forming.</p>
        <p><strong>Protection: </strong>The system is proven to protect woven mesh screens on lower decks, dramatically reducing screening costs and improving HSE.</p>
        <p><strong>Built to last: </strong>The use of durable materials and a proven clamping system allows the Swarf Screening System to enjoy an extended life cycle, resulting in lower screen costs and zero downtime.</p>
        <p><strong>Weight: </strong>Using the same design principles as the AX Screening System gives each Swarf Removal Screen a weight of 6 kg&mdash;promoting ease of handling and simple insertion/removal.</p>
        <p><strong>Storage: </strong>With the same physical dimensions as a standard AX Screen, each Swarf Removal Screen can be easily stored in a standard BRANDT AX Screen Rack.</p>
