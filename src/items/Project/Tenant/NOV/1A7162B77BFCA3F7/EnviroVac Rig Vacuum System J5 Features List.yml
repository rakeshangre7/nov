        <h2>Accelerated transfer and clean-up of liquids and slurries</h2>
        <p>Superior operational performance as well as unitized packaging make the EnviroVac rig vacuum system extremely efficient and flexible in a variety of applications. By routing pick-up lines to specified areas where liquid or slurry spills may occur, the EnviroVac can be used for performing a variety of clean-up duties.</p>
        <h2>Unitized packaging</h2>
        <p>The unitized packaging allows the EnviroVac to be assembled on a single skid. This space-saving design incorporates the vacuum pump, collection vessel (with safety float switch), and filter vessel. Once a power supply is installed and piping/hoses are routed to the desired pick-up points, the EnviroVac is ready for duty.</p>
        <p>The EnviroVac can operate manually or automatically and is designed for simple, effective operation. In manual vacuum mode, the safety shutdown functions remain in operation to protect the blower from ingesting liquid. In the manual discharge mode, there is no shutdown. Once the tank is empty, the unit becomes an air blower. In the automatic mode, the unit will fill and discharge automatically. Time-delay relays (on vacuum start and discharge start), along with the option to operate the relays in interval mode, give the operator maximum operating flexibility.</p>
