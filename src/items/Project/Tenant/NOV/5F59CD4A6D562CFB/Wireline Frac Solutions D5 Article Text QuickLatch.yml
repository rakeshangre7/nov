        <h4>QuickLatch standard</h4>
        <p>Our compact QuickLatch connector features a single external moving piston to maximize reliability and keep the mechanism safe from handling damage.</p>
        <p>The standard orientation features the stinger pin on PCE quick connect; this facilitates applications for which night cap installation is required. Its weight is 396 kg including the night cap.</p>
        <h4>QuickLatch with night cap arm</h4>
        <p>The night cap is easily removed and fitted using the control module with the night cap arm system. Robust and simple hydraulic cylinders retract the night cap and rotate it to a storage pot for safe keeping during operations. No parts of the night cap arm system protrude above the entry guide when the cap is removed, making it easier for your crane operators when stabbing the PCE.</p>
        <h4>QuickLatch inverted</h4>
        <p>When your operations don&rsquo;t require night caps, our inverted QuickLatch reduces your equipment cost. Connected to the PCE, and with the stinger pin on the well head, a single latch can be used for all the wells on the pad. This single latch allows a simpler, low-cost control module to complete your cost reductions.</p>
        <h4>Indication</h4>
        <p>Presence of well pressure within the QuickLatch is shown by a red indicator built into the smart manifold block, which can be seen through a Perspex&reg; window. When in the unlatched position, the yellow marker is visible, while there is no indicator visible when latched.</p>
        <h4>QuickLatch control module</h4>
        <p>Our QuickLatch control module (QLCM) is an aluminum skid-based, diesel-powered control module. The QLCM is designed to operate a QuickLatch and night cap arm on up to four independent wellheads.</p>
