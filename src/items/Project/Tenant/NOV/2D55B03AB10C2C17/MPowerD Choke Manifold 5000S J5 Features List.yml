        <p>The MPowerD&trade; 5000S Managed Pressure Drilling Choke and Control System is designed for use in a wider range of managed pressure drilling (MPD) applications and is suitable for land, shelf, and offshore drilling operations. The MPowerD control system allows automatic control of the choke with a complete list of automated features. Our 5000S system can also be connected to the powerful NOV Comprehensive Hydraulics Model that provides a real-time pressure response, given any changes in drilling parameters in order to keep bottomhole pressure constant in a defined anchor point.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The MPD Control System supports Dual Choke Mode, enabling manual control of a secondary choke while the primary choke is in automatic mode. The system can also be configured to automatically swap chokes if a fault is detected or it is unable to reach the target setpoint by using the primary choke. If needed, chokes can be changed from primary control to secondary control while in operation to save time maintaining the target wellbore pressure.&nbsp;</p>
