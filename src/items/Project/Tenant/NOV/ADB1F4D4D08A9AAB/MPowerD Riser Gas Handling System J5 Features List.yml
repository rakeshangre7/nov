      Hint: description
      Value: |
        <p>The MPowerD&trade; riser gas handling (RGH) system is an engineering solution that enables safe drilling of deepwater wells through safe handling of unintended gas in the marine drilling riser.
        </p>
        <p>The system enables a controlled circulation of gas that migrates above the subsea blowout preventer (BOP) with reduced risk for personnel, the environment, and your drilling budget. The RGH system easily scales to enable surface back pressure managed pressure drilling (MPD) and pressurized mud-cap drilling by adding additional equipment components.
        </p>
        <p>Our scalable RGH system can be easily retrofitted and handled, offering improved safety in deepwater and ultradeepwater projects driven by high-pressure targets and tight drilling windows. Our system meets current tensile strengths of risers, making it ideal for use in mature fields exhibiting formation depletion that reduces the available drilling window. The system also assists in exploration wells where formation pressures are uncertain and kicks are possible.</p>
