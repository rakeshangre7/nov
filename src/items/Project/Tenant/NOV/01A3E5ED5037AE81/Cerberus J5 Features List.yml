        <h2><strong>Cerberus for Well Intervention</strong></h2>
        <p>Cerberus for well intervention is a unique software for planning the deployment of tools, especially in highly deviated or complex trajectory wells. This is accomplished by modeling the cumulative mechanical and hydraulic forces to ensure that the target depth can be reached, job performed, and the tools returned to surface safely and efficiently with the chosen conveyance method and equipment configuration.</p>
        <p>Cerberus for well intervention consists of forces and/or wellbore hydraulics modeling.</p>
        <p>Forces modeling analyzes any operation involving the deployment of tools into and out of a well on cable, pipe, or coiled tubing. By analyzing the cumulative forces acting downhole at each stage of the job, the program determines whether the target depth can be reached, desired tasks are performed, and equipment is safely returned to surface. The main purpose is to determine the viability of a job design, thus improving operational safety and efficiency. The most important feature is the ability to model conditions in deviated and horizontal wellbores. Cerberus is also the only commercial program able to model all three conveyance methods in one package, making it invaluable for choosing the best well entry technique in marginal conditions. You may license the software to run one, two, or all three methods, with the price varying accordingly.</p>
        <p>Wellbore hydraulics modeling is used to calculate the pressures and flow rates during a wide variety of workover operations to optimize the job design and equipment selection. Applications include circulating, acidizing, cleaning, lifting, drilling, velocity strings, and injection. You can perform single snapshot calculations or simulate a complex sequence of events using a stage table.</p>
        <p>As well as planning for day-to-day operations, Cerberus has several special features to help you anticipate or deal with contingencies like the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stuck pipe and backoff operations (locating the stuck point; finding the neutral point)</li>
            <li>Buckled production tubing</li>
            <li>Advanced tool fit calculations (what size tool string will pass around a dogleg)</li>
            <li>Tractor pull requirements</li>
            <li>Fluid flow effects (tools pushed uphole by production; pumping tools downhole from surface)</li>
            <li>Extended-reach design</li>
            <li>Packer and completion analysis (PACA) ("tube movement")</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Cerberus does not model operations involving transients, such as jarring or perforating.</p>
        <h2><strong>Cerberus&nbsp;FEA Engine</strong></h2>
        <p>The Cerberus finite element analysis (FEA) engine is a highly flexible engineering tool for performing various types of buckling calculations.</p>
        <p>Cerberus performs buckling calculations of a pipe inside a wellbore or pressure-control stack. This software is intended for engineers and uses Microsoft&reg; Excel as the user interface. A user must have an engineering background and a working knowledge of Excel to use the software.</p>

        <h2><strong>Cerberus for well intervention</strong></h2>
        <p>Cerberus for well intervention is a unique software for planning the deployment of tools, especially in highly deviated or complex trajectory wells. This is accomplished by modeling the cumulative mechanical and hydraulic forces to ensure that the target depth can be reached, job performed, and the tools returned to surface safely and efficiently with the chosen conveyance method and equipment configuration.</p>
        <p>Cerberus for well intervention consists of forces and/or wellbore hydraulics modeling.</p>
        <p>Forces modeling analyzes any operation involving the deployment of tools into and out of a well on cable, pipe, or coiled tubing. By analyzing the cumulative forces acting downhole at each stage of the job, the program determines whether the target depth can be reached, desired tasks are performed, and equipment is safely returned to surface. The main purpose is to determine the viability of a job design, thus improving operational safety and efficiency. The most important feature is the ability to model conditions in deviated and horizontal wellbores. Cerberus is also the only commercial program able to model all three conveyance methods in one package, making it invaluable for choosing the best well entry technique in marginal conditions. You may license the software to run one, two, or all three methods, with the price varying accordingly.</p>
        <p>Wellbore hydraulics modeling is used to calculate the pressures and flow rates during a wide variety of workover operations to optimize the job design and equipment selection. Applications include circulating, acidizing, cleaning, lifting, drilling, velocity strings, and injection. You can perform single snapshot calculations or simulate a complex sequence of events using a stage table.</p>
        <p>As well as planning for day-to-day operations, Cerberus has several special features to help you anticipate or deal with contingencies like the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stuck pipe and backoff operations (locating the stuck point; finding the neutral point)</li>
            <li>Buckled production tubing</li>
            <li>Advanced tool fit calculations (what size tool string will pass around a dogleg)</li>
            <li>Tractor pull requirements</li>
            <li>Fluid flow effects (tools pushed uphole by production; pumping tools downhole from surface)</li>
            <li>Extended-reach design</li>
            <li>Packer and completion analysis (PACA) ("tube movement")</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Cerberus does not model operations involving transients, such as jarring or perforating.</p>
        <h2><strong>Cerberus&nbsp;FEA engine</strong></h2>
        <p>The Cerberus finite element analysis (FEA) engine is a highly flexible engineering tool for performing various types of buckling calculations.</p>
        <p>Cerberus performs buckling calculations of a pipe inside a wellbore or pressure-control stack. This software is intended for engineers and uses Microsoft&reg; Excel as the user interface. A user must have an engineering background and a working knowledge of Excel to use the software.</p>
