        <p>Our Pressure Control While Drilling (PCWD) is an active system with full API 16RCD certification that enables operators to safely control pressure in the annulus during underbalanced or managed pressure drilling (MPD) conditions.</p>
        <p>The PCWD is installed in the blowout preventer (BOP) stack. The rotating spherical (RS) BOP is an annular BOP using an elastomeric sealing element (packing element) capable of rotating and designed to close and seal the wellbore annular area with pipe or a kelly in the hole. An annulus pressure seal can also be maintained while the drill string is stripped during tripping operations. The unique aspect of the PCWD is its method of sealing the annulus. The PCWD is also able to close and seal on an open wellbore. The PCWD system is designed to maintain a seal, automatically adjusting the PCWD packing element closing force as the wellbore pressure changes in order to minimize pipe drag and packing element wear.</p>
