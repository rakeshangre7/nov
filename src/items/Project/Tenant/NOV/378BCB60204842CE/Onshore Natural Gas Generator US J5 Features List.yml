        <p>With both stationary and mobile EPA certification, the natural gas generator cuts down on emissions and annual site testing that is otherwise necessary. Our natural gas generators use naturally supplied fuel that would normally flare, cutting fuel costs substantially with a savings of nearly 40% per month (depending on size of machine). The generator is powered by the renowned Cummins engine.</p>
        <p>Using satellite telemetry, each of our units can be monitored for the exact location, run time, fault code, and indication of any unit that needs service. This eliminates wasted downtime and allows you to always know where the asset is located while ensuring the most accurate billing.</p>
        <p>Portable Power manufactures and rents portable generators and lighting and temperature equipment for any job site. Generator rental includes natural gas and diesel power for land and offshore use.</p>
