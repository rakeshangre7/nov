      Value: "<p>Elmar slotted and holed liners are manufactured on specially designed multi-spindled machines that assure a high level of machining accuracy while maintaining metallurgical properties through the continuous application of coolant during the cutting process. We can deburr pipes from 2⅜- to 12-in. OD and 50-ft length with a purpose-built deburring machine. This machine can remove swarf, rust, and grease. After deburring, the pipes are given a protective coating to prevent further rust. Slot widths of 0.012 to 0.25 in. in a variety of patterns can be accommodated with a range of slot lengths to suit the requirement. Holed casing can be produced with a variety of hole patterns and pitches and with diameters from 9.5 to 25 mm.</p>"
