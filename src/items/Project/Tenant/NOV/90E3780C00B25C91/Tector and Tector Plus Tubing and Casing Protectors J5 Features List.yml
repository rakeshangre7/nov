        <p>Requirements for thread protection can be both simple and basic, but the primary objective is protecting the threads from environmental elements and providing coverage during storage. Both Tector™ and Tector Plus protectors were designed with your needs in mind, ensuring that you get outstanding protection at an affordable price.</p>
        
        <p>Keeping your pipe threads environmentally protected is of utmost importance to us here at Tuboscope MSI. Available in several design options, Tector tubing and casing protectors have been perfected over the years to ensure excellent environmental thread protection in an easy-to-use, lightweight option that gets the job done. 
        Likewise, our Tector Plus protectors have remained a preferred option in the Canadian market since the year 2000, when they were first offered to customers in that region. This product line offers all the same benefits as our Tector design, but with a slightly thicker level of plastic protection that provides additional value in your tubing and casing protection.</p>
        
        <p>Whether your need is in-storage protection or having your pipe covered while being transported within your yard, we know that you will find our Tector and Tector Plus product lines to be a perfect fit. Both product lines come in a variety of standard API sizes and thread connections for your convenience.</p>
