        <p>In an effort to reduce the operational costs of production facilities, NOV Wellstream Processing has developed the GoConnect&trade; digital service offering that optimizes system performance and maintenance efforts. Through the use of sensors, instruments and controllers to monitor and collect data from the platform or vessel, we analyse and predict potential issues before they occur. We combine our comprehensive selection of wellstream processing technologies and deep understanding of fluids behaviour from more than 40 years of experience, with NOV&rsquo;s track record of digitalization to solve actual issues.</p>
        <h2>Unique insights through advanced data analytics</h2>
        <p>Our digital offering enhances the visibility of current and historical performance, reducing the need for offshore supervision and allows for intelligent maintenance programs. We can prevent failures from happening again by analysing data and system behaviour leading up to them, providing enhanced warnings or prolonging the time for them to occur and thus reducing unplanned downtime. It also enables us to utilize data from the actual facility to improve the quality of performance models, allowing us to predict future performance in detail and whether modifications will be needed. </p>
        <p>A suite of process-specific applications can be fully integrated into any existing control system and has the flexibility to run locally or in the cloud to address the operator&rsquo;s data transfer or data communications requirements. The software application differs from typical remote monitoring initiatives in that it applies proven machine learning and predictive analytics frameworks to detect patterns and traces from the captured data to provide the earliest possible detection of future issues and provide proactive recommendations to prevent disruption to operations. This is the key to advancing offshore operations into production facilities of the future, such as unmanned facilities.</p>
        <p>Another important feature is the condition monitoring of rotating equipment within the topside systems. We can determine the efficiency and health of each piece of equipment and the impact on process performance by collecting sensor data associated with rotating equipment operations. This information enables the user to detect early signs of wear on parts, so they can make a more proactive decision to schedule maintenance, order aftermarket parts or change the operation of the equipment to extend the life and/or prevent failures from happening.</p>
        <h2>GoConnect<sup>TM </sup>Digital Services for Seawater Treatment Systems</h2>
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>One of the most commonly used methods to optimize recovery of oil from a given reservoir is to inject seawater into the reservoir to maintain the reservoir pressure. To prevent clogging of the reservoir and to maintain injectivity, the seawater normally has chemicals added to prevent bio fouling and has particulate matter removed by filters and membranes to ensure compatibility with the existing water in the formation. As these filter and membranes are very sensitive to the operating conditions, it is important to have early detection of changes within the system and react quickly with appropriate mitigation program to prevent fouling of the system.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>The seawater treatment (SWT) condition monitoring application optimize SWT system performance and maintenance. It runs system-wide analytics of the SWT process by ingesting current and historical data from SWT operations into a cloud-based analytics program that provides insights into SWT operations that have never been seen before.</p>
        <p>A visualisation of the GoConnect&trade; User Interface (UI) is presented below, allowing the user to explore as many details as of interest as well as trend any combination of data streams.</p>
        <p><img alt="SWT Dashboard" src="-/media/1b4ad95f42cf4fe8b83825da4cec4089.ashx?h=317&amp;w=650" style="width: 650px; height: 317px;" /></p>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>Through analysis of a significant amount of historical data, the SWT application is now able to not only detect the onset of fouling but can also accurately identify the type of fouling happening within the system, differentiating between the five most commonly found in SWT systems. This patent pending fouling identification enables the user to identify the fouling type and eliminate the guesswork and false alarms, allowing for quick deployment of precise mitigation programs that include chemical treatment, exposure time of chemicals, and schedule of cleaning cycles. The operator can then optimize the cleaning-in-place (CIP) sequences, perform timely CIP and chemical dosing to extend the life of the membranes, avoiding unnecessary downtime while also preventing permanent membrane damage. This enables operators to save a significant amount of money per year due to extended membrane life, downtime reduction, and production penalty prevention.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the result is the conversion of large amounts of data into clear messages in the form of alerts of what has been detected as well as recommendations for mitigation as illustrated below.</p>
