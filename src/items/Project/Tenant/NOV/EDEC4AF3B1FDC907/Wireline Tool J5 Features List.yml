        <p>The universal pulling tool is a field-proven alternative to conventional pulling tools and reduces the number of tools required in a toolbox, owing to its adjustable core length and the ability to change its mode of shearing. The brand-new roller conveyance system (RCS) enables access to highly deviated wellbores with its simple, robust design. Tools can be manufactured with QLS, HD, or SR&nbsp; connections or as an alternative with the Elmar&trade; high-strength breach-lock connection. Our wireline tools product suite includes conveyance, fishing, debris removal, tubing punch, and bespoke.</p>
        <p>We also manufacture and supply a wide range of flow control items for tubing sizes from 2⅜ through 7 in. The equipment can be custom designed to suit specific projects and is suitable for most well types including high-value, high-pressure subsea completions. Our flow control products include locks, plugs, landing nipples, isolation sleeves, valves, and all necessary pulling and running tools.</p>
