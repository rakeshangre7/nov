        <h2>Separating, stabilizing, and securing your tubulars</h2>
        <p>In addition to the comprehensive range of thread protection products at Tuboscope MSI&rsquo;s Pipe Protection Technologies, we also offer bumper rings and pipe chocks as complementary pipe protection accessories. Our SpiraGuard bumper rings assist in damage prevention by eliminating contact friction often caused by multiple joints of unseparated pipe in storage or transit. Pipe chocks are used to stabilize tubulars both in yard storage and in transportation. Additionally, plastic pipe chocks produced from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) offer a better solution and a longer lifespan over wooden alternatives that are subjected to a higher rate of damage from elements and are more difficult to install and remove.</p>
