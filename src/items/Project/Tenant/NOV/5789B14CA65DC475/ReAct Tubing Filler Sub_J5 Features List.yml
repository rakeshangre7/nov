      Hint: description
      Value: <p>This is achieved by a fluid entering the tubing from the annulus via four ports. Once the barrier device has been run to the required depth, the tubing filler sub is closed by building tubing pressure. This creates a backpressure that shifts the blanking sleeve to the closed position. The ports are now sealed shut, and the blanking sleeve is positively locked with a snap ring. The simple design of the Tubing Filler Sub ensures its reliable operation. A shifting profile is included in the inside diameter (ID) of the blanking sleeve so that it can be mechanically shifted if required.&nbsp;</p>
