        <p><strong>A more efficient way to fulfil your dewatering needs</strong></p>
        <p>WellSite Services&rsquo; FluidControl group combines a premix tank and a floc tank (flocculent in-situ tank) to reduce trucking time and use the wellsite area more effectively. The processing tank is equipped with a 5 &times; 6 in. centrifugal pump driven by either a 60-hp electrical motor or a 471 Detroit diesel engine. The mud mixing venture hopper provides a homogeneous mixing action for blending mud as well as dewatering chemicals to accommodate the dewatering process.</p>
        <p>Ranging in sizes from 300 to 470 bbl (47 to 75 m<sup>3</sup>), the processing tanks are designed with two or three large-capacity tank sections as well as two 28-bbl (4.5-m<sup>3</sup>) flocculent mixing compartments. Agitators are provided in the floc mixing sections. Plumbed into the flocculent tank sections are three variable-drive Moyno&trade; pumps. These pumps are designed to provide precise feeding capabilities to the centrifuges. The two-compartment design of the in-situ floc tank allows continual feed by batch-mixing flocculent and switching between tanks. To ensure optimum performance for cold weather operations, all FluidControl processing tanks are equipped with steam coils throughout each compartment. They are also equipped with either a steam or electrical heater in the mud mixing pump room.</p>
