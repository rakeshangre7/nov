      Hint: description
      Value: "<p>Our progressive cavity pumps provide the gentlest pumping action on the market for solids handling, offering minimal product degradation in shear-sensitive applications such as salad dressings and salsas while being able to move suspended solids with minimal damage to products such as diced fruits, vegetables, and soups. Designed to the highest hygienic standards—EHEDG and 3-A certifications—the robust nature of our progressive cavity pump allows it to handle varying viscosities, including viscous slurries (even over 1,000,000 cps) such as peanut butter, candies, and jam. The positive displacement action of the pump allows for variable speed control for efficient, slow-speed pumping and process control for accurate dosing.</p>"

        <ul>
        <li>3-A certification</li>
        <li>Quick disassembly design for easy cleaning</li>
        <li>Non-pulsating, metered flow—ideal for batching processes</li>
        <li>No valves to clog, stick, or vapor lock</li>
        <li>Transfer solids up to 1-in. (25-mm) diameter</li>
        <li>Easy, on-site maintenance—pump features a detachable titanium flexishaft, which allows for easy maintenance and dismantling for cleaning out of place if required</li>
        <li>Easy, on-site maintenance</li>
        <li>Cost-effectively handle thin liquids such as soups and juices</li>
        <li>Handle corrosive applications such as citric acid and vinegar</li>
        <li>Provides long service life in abrasive applications such as soybean slurries</li>
        <li>Consistently handle entrained air and gases in applications such as yeast and nougat</li>
        <li>Reduced the cost of ownership over the pump’s life—you no longer have to replace a complete drive train when a single component is worn, instead replacing the rotor and flexishaft independently when required</li>
        </ul>
