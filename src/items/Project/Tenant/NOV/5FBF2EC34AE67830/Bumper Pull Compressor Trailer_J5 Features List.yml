        <p>Our bumper-pull compressor trailer is specifically designed for use in oilwell cementing operations but can be used in a variety of settings in other industries for which an air supply is needed.</p>
        
        <p>The independently mounted compressor package consists of a Cummins QSF2.8T4F, Tier 4, 74-hp (55-kW) diesel engine and a Gardner Denver APOG air compressor. The auto-kill system detects high water temperatures, RPM over speed, and low oil pressure and shuts down the engine to prevent damage if any of these parameters measures out of acceptable limits. The compressor unit will produce 205 ft3/min (348 m3/hr) and 30 psi (207 kPa) at 1,072 RPM.</p>
        
        <p>The trailer discharge has a 2-in. (50.8-mm) Figure 206, FPT union and a 7,000-lb (3175-kg) rated tandem, leaf-spring mechanical suspension with electric brakes.</p>

        <p>Compressed air solutions are required for your bulk cement services. We can provide a full range of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FD167300875244A5A101C10C9A2D9373&amp;_z=z">Wilco&trade;</a>&nbsp;reciprocating and rotary screw compressors to fit your operations. These same systems can be used in other industrial applications requiring compressed air.</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h2>Bumper-pull compressor trailer
        </h2>
        <p>The Wilco bumper-pull compressor trailer is a mobile air supply for pneumatically displaced bulk materials, such as cement, that incorporates a Cummins QSF2.8T4F engine and belt-drive compressor. Our bumper-pull compressor trailer is specifically designed for use in oil well cementing operations but can be used in a variety of settings in other industries for which an air supply is needed.
        The independently mounted compressor package consists of a Cummins QSF2.8T4F, Tier 4, 74-hp (55-kW) diesel engine and a Gardner Denver APOG air compressor. The auto-kill system detects high water temperatures, RPM over speed, and low oil pressure and shuts down the engine to prevent damage if any of these parameters measures out of acceptable limits. The compressor unit will produce 205 ft3/min (348 m3/hr) and 30 psi (207 kPa) at 1,072 RPM.
        </p>
        <h2>Dual Air Compressor</h2>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>The Wilco dual air compressor is skid mounted with dual cylinder pumps, and it produces 410 ft3/min (680 m3/hr) at 1,072 rpm. Our Wilco air compressor skids are fitted complete with a Tier 3 diesel engine (with radiator, fan, air cleaner, electric start, and emergency kill system), compressor air inlet filters, moisture separator, automatic drain, two 9.5-ft3 air receiver tanks, an air-to-air aftercooler with a 12-volt fan, and belt guards. The compressed air outlet is fitted with one 3-in. camlock and check valve. All equipment is mounted on an I-beam skid base with a four-point lift frame.
        </p>
        <h2>Rotary Screw Air Compressor
        </h2>
        <p>The Wilco rotary screw air compressor is equipped with a 9.5 ft&sup3; receiver tank mounted on an I-beam skid frame with forklift slots and a center lift point. Our Wilco unit features a Cat&reg; C4.4 (Tier 4 or Tier III export) diesel engine with an optional spark arrestor. Large service doors provide easy access to the fuel tank, engine, compressor, air filters, and tool storage compartment. Rear service panels provide access to the side-by-side compressor fluid cooler, engine air cooler, and engine radiator. Capacity control is zero to 100% with the pneumatic inlet valve and unloaded starting.
        The unit incorporates a shutdown system and annunciation module for high compressor temperature, high engine coolant temperature, low engine oil pressure, engine under speed, and low fuel shutdown. The unit will produce 375 ft3/min at a rated pressure of 100 psig and has a pressure range of 80 to 125 psig.
        </p>
        <h2>Single Air Compressor
        </h2>
        <p>The Wilco single air compressor skid is used for pneumatic displacement of bulk materials such as cement, sand, drilling mud bulk constituents, or other powdered or granular materials. Our Wilco&trade; unit includes an electric starter, radiator, air cleaner, and emergency kill system. All equipment is mounted on a heavy-duty structural beam-skid with a four-point lift frame. The unit also incorporates a shutdown system and annunciation module for high compressor temperature, high engine coolant temperature, low engine oil pressure, engine under speed, and low fuel shutdown. The unit will produce 205 ft3/min (348 m3/hr) at 1,072 engine rpm and 30 psi (207 kPa).</p>
