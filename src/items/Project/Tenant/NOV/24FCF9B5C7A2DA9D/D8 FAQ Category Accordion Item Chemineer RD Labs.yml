        <p>The Chemineer Research and Development (R&amp;D) Laboratory is in Dayton, Ohio, and is broken down into two different areas: customer testing and R&amp;D.</p>
        <h3>Customer Testing Facility</h3>
        <p>Not every application in mixing has been studied, and many applications are difficult to model computationally. As a result, it is sometimes necessary to scale down the problem and study it in the laboratory. Our Customer Testing facility houses an OSHA-compliant 144-square-foot hood used for a myriad of dynamic and static mixing applications. Available in our Customer Testing Facility are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Dynamic Agitators</li>
        <li>Impellers</li>
        <li>Static Mixers</li>
        <li>Centrifugal and Positive Displacement Pumps</li>
        <li>Spargers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Research and Development Lab</h3>
        <p>The process design technology that works its way into our expert design programs comes from our continued research and development in the fields of mixing and agitation.</p>
        <p>New products start in R&amp;D and we are continually searching for highly efficient and cost-effective impellers, impeller systems, static mixers, and static mixer systems. We use various tools to assist us in evaluating the individual possibilities. These include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>DPIV (Digital Particle Image Velocimetry) and LDA (Laser Doppler Anemometry) to evaluate both instantaneous and time-averaged velocity vector fields</li>
        <li>LIF (Laser Induced Fluorescence) for blending studies</li>
        <li>CFM (Computational Fluid Mixing)</li>
        <li>Full-scale vessels with strained gaged shafting for studying impeller hydraulic loads and power characteristics</li>
        <li>Full-scale tanks for adequacy of scale-up rules as well as for the testing of new drives,</li>
        <li>An apparatus that simultaneously provides a reading of torque and thrust</li>
        <li>A wind tunnel for gas-gas blending, among other tools.</li>
        </ul>
