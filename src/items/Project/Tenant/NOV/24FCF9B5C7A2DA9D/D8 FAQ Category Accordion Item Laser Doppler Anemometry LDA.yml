        <p>Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) is widely recognized as the best method of non-intrusively determining mean velocity and turbulence data with pinpoint accuracy. Chemineer uses the Dantec FlowLite turnkey measurement system to determine velocities in stirred tanks and static mixers.</p>
        <p>This measurement technique relies on the fact that when two laser beams of the same wavelength cross, an interference pattern of bright and dark fringes is formed. As a single particle passes through the intersection of two such laser beams, it reflects light at certain frequencies which depends only on the velocity of the particle and the fringe spacing. Appropriate optical collection and data analysis enables highly accurate velocity measurements within extremely small volumes of fluid. Within minutes, thousands of particles may pass through the measurement volume, enabling an accurate determination of velocity at that point.</p>
        <p>Chemineer uses these measurements to verify ChemScale and characterize specific impeller zones. This information may often be used with CFM to accurately determine the flow in the mixing vessel.</p>
