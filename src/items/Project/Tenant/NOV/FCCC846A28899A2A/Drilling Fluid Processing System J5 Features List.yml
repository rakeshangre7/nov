        <h2>A comprehensive drilling fluid system engineered for efficiency</h2>
        <p>We manufacture and supply a full range of drilling-fluid processing equipment and control systems that help our customers plan, route, and automate their bulk handling and mixing operations.</p>
        <h3>Drilling fluid solutions made to maximize</h3>
        <p>Our drilling fluid system maximize your asset value by helping to reduce nonproductive time (NPT), overall costs, and HSE impacts. </p>
        <p>Our <strong>solids control</strong> solution simplifies asset management through remote and automated operation of shale-shaker feed-gate valves, remote operation of degassers, and remote operation of cutting screws, including auto sequences.</p>
        <p>Our <strong>mix/additive</strong> offers reliable, improved performance through a process overview, an automated hopper/mixer, and automatic feeding that can be completed from the sack-cutting unit, big-bag emptying unit, liquid skid, and surge tank feeder (measuring density, weigh maintenance, batch, and rate modes).</p>
        <p>For <strong>storage and pumping</strong>, we elevate your efficiency with a process overview as well as level monitoring with density, tank content labels, and tripping of LP pumps on level in batch mode. Our automatic operations, including valve lineup for mixing and circulation, transfer between tanks, and operation of agitators, help reduce your NPT and overall costs.

        <h2>A comprehensive drilling fluid system engineered for efficiency</h2>
        <p>We manufacture and supply a full range of drilling-fluid processing equipment and control systems that help our customers plan, route, and automate their bulk handling and mixing operations. Our drilling fluid system maximize your asset value by helping to reduce nonproductive time (NPT), overall costs, and HSE impacts.</p>
        <p>Our <strong>solids control</strong> solution simplifies asset management through remote and automated operation of shale-shaker feed-gate valves, remote operation of degassers, and remote operation of cutting screws, including auto sequences.</p>
        <p>Our <strong>mix/additive</strong> offers reliable, improved performance through a process overview, an automated hopper/mixer, and automatic feeding that can be completed from the sack-cutting unit, big-bag emptying unit, liquid skid, and surge tank feeder (measuring density, weigh maintenance, batch, and rate modes).</p>
        <p>For <strong>storage and pumping</strong>, we elevate your efficiency with a process overview as well as level monitoring with density, tank content labels, and tripping of LP pumps on level in batch mode. Our automatic operations, including valve lineup for mixing and circulation, transfer between tanks, and operation of agitators, help reduce your NPT and overall costs. Also, our integrated operation of high-pressure shear units and high-rate mixers enables a simpler, smoother operation.</p>
