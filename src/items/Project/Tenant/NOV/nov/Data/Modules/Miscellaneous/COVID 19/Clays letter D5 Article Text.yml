        <h2>To Our Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>Every day, the thousands of individuals who collectively form our global family at NOV make a positive impact in both our industry and the communities where we live and work. I am proud of the role our company plays in helping meet the world's growing demand for energy and proud of the ingenuity and sense of service my colleagues continually apply to progress our organization and our industry.</p>
        <p>NOV remains a leader in the design, manufacture, and sale of equipment and components used in the energy industry by pursuing purposeful innovation and fostering a service-first culture. As that leader, we understand and fully embrace our responsibility to continuously improve our Environmental, Social, and Governance performance—both in our operations and in the products and services we bring to our customers.</p>
        <p>This means we are dedicated to providing equipment that allows our customers to work more efficiently while reducing their overall environmental footprint. We continue to pioneer technologies through increased levels of equipment automation and predictive analytics that take people out of the harm's way, help prevent operational issues, reduce waste, and drive efficiencies for our customers. In addition to our significant presence in the oil and gas industry, we also adapt our technologies to fit emerging alternative energy markets.</p>
        <p>As a global organization, NOV comprises predominantly local workforces. This diversity broadens our perspectives, strengthens community ties, and reminds us, over and over, that our greatest asset is our people.</p>
        <p>Our NOV family prioritizes ESG performance in our day-to-day activities, communities, and the products and services that we provide. I hope the drive and ingenuity of our team members will inspire you as much as it continually inspires me.</p>

        <h2>To Our Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>Every day, the thousands of individuals who collectively form our global family at NOV make a positive impact in both our industry and the communities where we live and work. I am proud of the role our company plays in helping meet the world's growing demand for energy and proud of the ingenuity and sense of service my colleagues continually apply to progress our organization and our industry.</p>
        <p>NOV remains a leader in the design, manufacture, and sale of equipment and components used in the energy industry by pursuing purposeful innovation and fostering a service-first culture. As that leader, we understand and fully embrace our responsibility to continuously improve our Environmental, Social, and Governance performance—both in our operations and in the products and services we bring to our customers.</p>
        <p>This means we are dedicated to providing equipment that allows our customers to work more efficiently while reducing their overall environmental footprint. We continue to pioneer technologies through increased levels of equipment automation and predictive analytics that take people out of the harm's way, help prevent operational issues, reduce waste, and drive efficiencies for our customers. In addition to our significant presence in the oil and gas industry, we also adapt our technologies to fit emerging alternative energy markets.</p>
        <p>As a global organization, NOV comprises predominantly local workforces. This diversity broadens our perspectives, strengthens community ties, and reminds us, over and over, that our greatest asset is our people.</p>
        <p>Our NOV family prioritizes ESG performance in our day-to-day activities, communities, and the products and services that we provide. I hope the drive and ingenuity of our team members will inspire you as much as it continually inspires me.</p>

        <h2>Clay Williams on COVID-19 Pandemic and Market Conditions
        </h2>
        <p>The impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on operations and oil demand, coupled with an oversupply of oil, is unprecedented and daunting - even for an industry with a long and proud history of persevering through tough challenges.&nbsp;This may be the toughest challenge of our generation, but it will not break us. Those of us who keep the world supplied in energy embody grit and determination, and we will persevere once again.
        </p>
        <p>We want you to know that while striving to keep employees healthy and safe,&nbsp;NOV is undertaking extraordinary efforts to meet your short- and long-term needs. We are doing everything in our power to continue to be here for you, providing the technology, equipment, and services needed to support your operations.
        </p>
        <p>Over the decades, the oil and gas industry has achieved amazing advancements, which have enabled it to meet growing demand for energy for more than 160 years.&nbsp;Today we jointly continue that legacy of resourcefulness, practicality, and innovation.&nbsp;Standing together has always pulled us through tough times and will do so again.&nbsp;Hang in there.
