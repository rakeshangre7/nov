        <p>Reduce flag entanglement and prevent unauthorized removal with our internal halyard system using a rotating truck, marine quality halyard and hardware, and sleek-looking locking hand hole cover. All flag pole shafts are prestressed with high tensile steel cables, providing internal strength and resilience. High-strength concrete is added and spun-cast to produce a pole of superior durability. Our poles are made in the US, come with a 10-year warranty, and are available in three shapes: round, octagonal, and square.</p>
