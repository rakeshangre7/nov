        <h2>Reduce downtime and increase capacity with the first modular shale shaker system.
        </h2>
        <p>The first of its kind, SABRE&trade; is a modular shaker system based on a scalable platform that can easily be changed from a single deck shaker to a double deck shaker and from a double deck shaker to a triple deck shaker. This simple upgrade can be made in the field, eliminating the need to change out the complete shale shaker system and enabling Sabre to be easily adapted to customer-specific needs.
        </p>
        <h2>Enhanced fluids handling solutions and capacity
        </h2>
        <p>Field tests have shown that the SABRE shaker has one-and-a-half to two times the fluids-handling capacity of existing high-performance shale shakers. This performance advantage enables SABRE to better control low-gravity solids (LGS) throughout the entire drilling process, thereby reducing dilution and associated logistics costs.
        </p>
        <p>This is due in part to the robust and differentiated design of SABRE. With the drive assemblies mounted directly over the sidewalls of the basket, energy is more effectively transferred to the screens. The SABRE&nbsp;G-force is set at 7 G&rsquo;s, with the counterweights adjustable to compensate for increasing the number of decks. These design features make SABRE&nbsp;a more potent primary screening system than any other in the industry.
        </p>
        <h2>Proven delivery compared to other high-performance shale shakers
        </h2>
        <p>In the latest field runs, SABRE&nbsp;consistently reduced oil retention on cuttings from around 11% to below 9%, decreasing both haul-off and disposal costs.
        </p>
        <p>For operators whose drilling application requires the retention and recovery of costly lost-circulation or wellbore-stabilization materials, the triple-deck configuration of SABRE&nbsp;can be set up to retain these particles and reintroduce them into the fluid handling system while still removing unwanted LGS.
        </p>
        <h2>Designed with simplicity and durability
        </h2>
        <p>In addition to improved performance, ease of use and durability were principal factors in the design of the SABRE&nbsp;shaker. SABRE&nbsp;shale shaker screens are super-lightweight (weighing only 14 lbs) and are repairable using NOV&rsquo;s unique AX SNAPFAST&trade; screen repair system. In addition, the screens are secured and sealed using NOV&rsquo;s industry-proven pneumoseal technology, enabling them to be quickly changed out by a single operator in a matter of minutes.
        </p>
        <p>For drilling rigs equipped with KING COBRA<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #707070;">&trade;</span> VENOM&trade; or HYBRID shakers, SABRE&nbsp;can be retrofitted into the existing skids, further reducing upfront costs and installation time.</p>

        <h2>The first modular shale shaker system</h2>
        <p>The first of its kind, SABRE&trade; is a modular shaker system based on a scalable platform that can easily be changed from a single-deck shaker to a double-deck shaker and from a double-deck shaker to a triple-deck shaker. This simple upgrade can be made in the field, eliminating the need to change out the complete system and enabling the BRANDT&trade; SABRE shaker to be easily adapted to your needs.</p>
        <h2>Enhanced fluid-handling capacity</h2>
        <p>Field tests have shown that the BRANDT SABRE shale shaker has one-and-a-half to <strong>two times the fluid-handling capacity</strong> of existing high-performance shale shakers. This performance advantage enables SABRE to better control low-gravity solids (LGS) throughout the entire drilling process, thereby reducing dilution and associated logistics costs.</p>
        <p>This is due in part to the robust and differentiated design of SABRE. With the drive assemblies mounted directly over the sidewalls of the basket, energy is more effectively transferred to the screens. The SABRE G-force is set at 7 G's, with the counterweights adjustable to compensate for increasing the number of decks. These design features make SABRE a more potent primary screening system than any other in the industry.</p>
        <h2>Field-proven BRANDT shaker delivery</h2>
        <p>In the latest field runs, SABRE consistently reduced oil retention on cuttings from around 11% to below 9%, decreasing both haul-off and disposal costs. For operators whose drilling application requires the retention and recovery of costly lost-circulation or wellbore-stabilization materials, the triple-deck configuration of SABRE can be set up to retain these particles and reintroduce them into the fluid-handling system while still removing unwanted LGS.</p>
        <h2>Designed with simplicity and durability</h2>
        <p>In addition to improved performance, ease of use and durability were principal factors in the design of the SABRE shaker. SABRE shale shaker screens are super-lightweight (weighing only 14 lbs) and are repairable using our unique AX SNAPFAST&trade; screen repair system. In addition, the screens are secured and sealed using our industry-proven pneumoseal technology, enabling them to be quickly changed out by a single operator in a matter of minutes.</p>
        <p>For drilling rigs equipped with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1866086E7568431ABC0E5C5CD3030FB2&amp;_z=z">KING COBRA&trade; VENOM&trade;</a>&nbsp;or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4C6B254F1147423087B1E84D7162633B&amp;_z=z">HYBRID</a>&nbsp;shakers, SABRE&nbsp;can be retrofitted into the existing skids, further reducing upfront costs and installation time.</p>
