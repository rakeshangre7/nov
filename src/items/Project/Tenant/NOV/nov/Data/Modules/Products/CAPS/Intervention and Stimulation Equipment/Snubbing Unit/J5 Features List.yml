        <p>Hydra Rig&trade; snubbing units have earned a reputation worldwide for high performance and versatility in the field. Our fast rig-up is due to the lightweight, compact design and the elimination of the need to &ldquo;kill&rdquo; the well.</p>
        <p>Hydra Rig snubbing units have earned a reputation worldwide for high performance and versatility in the field. Our fast rig-up is due to the lightweight, compact design and the elimination of the need to &ldquo;kill&rdquo; the well. The latest design innovations include the combination split-spool four-way regeneration control valve for smoother, more precise unit control and the newly designed 6,600 ft-lbs dual motor rotary. Units are available in the short-stroke configuration to operate at any wellhead pressure or wellhead height and in the long-stroke configuration for increased tubing running speed.</p>
        <p>Our snubbing units are designed to meet your snubbing and hydraulic workover requirements. Custom packages built to your specifications are available with a full line of auxiliary components such as work windows up to 600,00 lbs capacity, high-pressure circulating swivels up to 15,000-psi operating pressure, and skid-mounted mud pump packages. HRS 150 and 225 units are available in heli-transportable models for remote operations. DNV and BP200 certifications are available.</p>
