        <h2>Into deeper waters</h2>
        <p>Growing up by the water in the Netherlands with a passion for physics, Fons Huijs knew he wanted to work in marine technology. After studying naval architecture at Delft University of Technology, he joined GustoMSC designing offshore vessels, jackups, and semi-submersibles and preparing drawings and calculation reports to demonstrate the safety and performance of the designs.
        Currently, most offshore wind technology is bottom-founded, meaning it can only be built in shallow-water areas like the North Sea at depths up to 50 m. However, Fons Huijs and his team of engineers have been designing floating wind turbines for deeper waters, such as those around the US.</p>

        <p>When Broddrick Stringfellow returned to Texas after serving 4 years in the US Air Force, he wanted to continue making an impact in his community. After changing jobs a few times, he used his past CNC experience to secure a position at Grant Prideco as a machinist on the shop floor.</p>
        <p>But his drive didn't stop after starting at NOV. Broddrick worked night shifts to balance work with going back to school, earning both a bachelor's degree in human resources management and an MBA in finance in less than 4&frac12; years. Now, he's a supervisor of drill pipe production with more than 20 people reporting to him. He's also a member of the Grant Prideco Training Within Industry (TWI) team, which evaluates each department's procedures and creates job breakdowns to standardize tasks.</p>

        <p>After graduating from college in just 3 years with a bachelor's degree in psychology, Megan Phelps was hired to work in Human Resources (HR) at Artex, a wireline trucks and drilling tools manufacturer. While there, she obtained her master's degree in industrial organizational psychology and was promoted to HR manager. She also built key relationships with her coworkers on the shop floor, which helped her see first-hand that "the manufacturing or shop floor employees are the bread and butter of our business."</p>
        <p>After NOV acquired Artex, Megan was promoted to HR director within the Completion &amp; Production Solutions business segment. For her, the best part of her job is influencing change and developing people.</p>
