        <p>In response to an increasing number of surface casing applications that require gas pressure sealability, we now offer a gas-tight (GT) connector, the XLW-GT. Featuring an optimized internal metal seal design machined on high-strength pin and box forging material, the XLW-GT connector raises the bar on large-diameter connector seal performance under gas pressure loading.<br />
        <br />
        Extensive ISO/FDIS 13679:2011 testing has been completed with gas on multiple sizes to CAL I-E requirements and confirmed seal integrity up to 95% of actual X80 pipe body internal pressure ratings.<br />
        <br />
        Using the same wedge thread design as the widely used XLW connector, XLW-GT maintains 100% pipe body ratings in tension, compression, and bending. Since no anti-rotation feature installation is required due to the wedge thread design, strings are run faster and the risk of a dropped string from connector failure is minimized.</p>

        <h3>XLW-GT Connector Gas Testing</h3>
        <p>For gas-tight surface applications that require a metal-to-metal internal pressure seal, we offer the XLW-GT wedge thread connection. Testing has been completed up to 95% of actual X80 pipe body internal pressure ratings to ISO 13679 CAL I-E (with gas) requirements. The following sizes have been tested:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>20 x 0.750&nbsp; X80 XLW-GT</li>
            <li>22 x 1.00 X80 XLW-GT</li>
            <li>22 x 1.25 X80 XLW-GT</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The CAL I-E qualification requires the testing of two samples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first sample (ISO Specimen 1) is machined to an extreme tolerance, worst case sealing configuration and make-and-break tested. Upon completion, seal performance of this sample is then verified through a series of tests that include two-quadrant combined load with bending (ISO Series B), four-quadrant combined load (ISO Series A), and limit load to failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The second sample (ISO Specimen 5) is machined to an extreme tolerance, worst case galling configuration. This sample undergoes make-and-break testing only to verify resistance to galling.&nbsp;</li>
