        <p>Our SoftSpeed&trade; II stick-slip prevention service uses automated vibration dampening to mitigate torsional vibration and reduce stick-slip oscillations during drilling operations.</p>
        <p>Stick-slip oscillations are severe, self-sustained periodic fluctuations of drillstring torque and rotational speed driven by nonlinear downhole friction and characterized by large bit/bottomhole assembly (BHA) speed variations. The SoftSpeed II platform provides the analytics and capabilities required to automatically detect and mitigate these stick-slip oscillations, enabling you to maintain drilling efficiency and reduce equipment wear.</p>
        <p>The SoftSpeed II system is activated on demand by the driller, and the system&rsquo;s analyzer continuously identifies, quantifies, and alerts the driller of torsional vibrations. If the stick-slip severity indicator on the driller&rsquo;s screen shows a degree of stick slip, the driller can activate the SoftSpeed II system, and the auto-tuning feature enables the speed controller to provide optimal damping to mitigate stick-slip occurrences. The SoftSpeed II system is designed to be passive and does not inject additional energy into the drillstring. The result is a stable, robust, and proven controller built on decades of experience and know-how.</p>
        <p>A dedicated user interface provides simple operation as well as access to relevant graphical trends. The service component offers training and support to help you maximize the system&rsquo;s use and results. A daily SoftSpeed II report is sent to the rig and back-office personnel, keeping your team informed of the service&rsquo;s usage and performance.</p>

        <p>M/D Totco's&trade; SoftSpeed&trade; II stick/slip prevention service uses automated vibration dampening to mitigate torsional vibration and reduce stick/slip oscillations during drilling operations.</p>
        <p>Stick/slip oscillations are severe, self-sustained periodic fluctuations of drill string torque and rotational speed driven by nonlinear downhole friction and characterized by large bit/bottomhole assembly (BHA) speed variations. The SoftSpeed II platform provides the analytics and capabilities required to automatically detect and mitigate these stick/slip oscillations, enabling you to maintain drilling efficiency and reduce equipment wear.</p>
        <p>The SoftSpeed II system is activated on demand by the driller, and the system&rsquo;s analyzer continuously identifies, quantifies, and alerts the driller of torsional vibrations. If the stick/slip severity indicator on the driller&rsquo;s screen shows a degree of stick/slip, the driller can activate the SoftSpeed II system, and the auto-tuning feature enables the speed controller to provide optimal damping to mitigate stick/slip occurrences. The SoftSpeed II system is designed to be passive and does not inject additional energy into the drill string. The result is a stable, robust, and proven controller built on decades of experience and know-how.</p>
        <p>A dedicated user interface provides simple operation as well as access to relevant graphical trends. The service component offers training and support to help you maximize the system&rsquo;s use and results. A daily SoftSpeed II report is sent to the rig and back-office personnel, keeping your team informed of the service&rsquo;s usage and performance.</p>
