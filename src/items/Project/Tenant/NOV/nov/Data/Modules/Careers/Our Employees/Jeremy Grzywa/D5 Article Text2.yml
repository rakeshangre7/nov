        <h2>Changing winds: A new direction in energy</h2>
        <p>As Fons&rsquo; work shifts more toward offshore wind technology, he&rsquo;s motivated by the fast-paced expansion of wind energy and the opportunity to be part of a global energy transition that reduces carbon emissions. Just a little more than a decade ago, a client was happy to have five 5-MW wind turbines installed within a few months. Now, vessels designed by GustoMSC can install one 10-MW turbine in a day.</p>
        <p>As the global winds blow toward a greener future with less use of carbon-burning fuels and more application of alternative energies, Fons sees this as an opportunity for major oil and gas companies to pave the way. &ldquo;For the long-term solution, we should invest in technology for renewable energy, because that&rsquo;s where a lot of growth is. It&rsquo;s an opportunity [for NOV] to use our experience from offshore oil and gas in a new area.&rdquo; So, it&rsquo;s not one energy source competing against the other. Rather, oil and gas companies are among the top organizations driving the expansion and innovation of alternative energies.</p>
        <p>Like many others, Fons is excited about NOV&rsquo;s decision to take a new direction and invest in companies such as GustoMSC that are active in offshore wind.</p>

        <p>Jeremy returned stateside in 2014 and is now the senior manager for digital marketing within Rig Technologies. Currently, the group is broadening its scope into the offshore construction market by integrating recent acquisitions in manufacturing and vessel design, providing the expertise needed to design and outfit vessels capable of installing offshore windmills and laying pipe and cable.</p>
        <p>At NOV, employees use their interests and passions to drive their own career paths. Jeremy is a perfect example, with his journey at NOV taking him far&mdash;literally.</p>
