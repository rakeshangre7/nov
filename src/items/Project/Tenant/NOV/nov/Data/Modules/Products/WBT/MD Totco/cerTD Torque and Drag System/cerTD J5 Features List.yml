        <p>NOV’s cerT&amp;D™ real-time torque and drag data collection and monitoring system provides real-time information on downhole friction and hole issues during deviated drilling operations. The system works in conjunction with your rigsite instrumentation, providing torque and drag data that help you make necessary adjustments to reduce the chance of getting stuck, lower the risk of damaged equipment, and improve wellbore quality.</p>
        <p>Torque and drag monitoring plays an integral part in diagnosing problems related to differential sticking, poor hole cleaning, severe doglegs, sloughing shale, excessive tortuosity, and many others. Our system supports all torque and drag models and provides three ways to capture the actual torque and drag data points, which can then be compared in real time to the model.</p>
        <p>In addition to standard manual torque and drag data collection, our cerT&amp;D system provides real-time guided and automatic-capture modes that eliminate the need for manual data entry and reduce the risk of human error. Our system ensures accurate torque and drag data at the correct intervals, which you can configure to take place at each connection, at specific depth intervals, or when a survey is approved. Leveraging the system’s high-resolution database, you can recalculate torque and drag values at any time for a custom data collection plan that meets your needs.</p>

        <p>Our cerT&amp;D&trade; real-time torque and drag data collection and monitoring system provides real-time information on downhole friction and hole issues during deviated drilling operations. A shared technology between our ReedHycalog and M/D Totco business units, the cerT&amp;D system works in conjunction with your rigsite instrumentation, providing torque and drag data that help you make necessary adjustments to reduce the chance of getting stuck, lower the risk of damaged equipment, and improve wellbore quality.</p>
        <p>Torque and drag monitoring plays an integral part in diagnosing problems related to differential sticking, poor hole cleaning, severe doglegs, sloughing shale, excessive tortuosity, and many others. Our system supports all torque and drag models and provides three ways to capture the actual torque and drag data points, which can then be compared in real time to the model.</p>
        <p>In addition to standard manual torque and drag data collection, our cerT&amp;D system provides real-time guided and automatic-capture modes that eliminate the need for manual data entry and reduce the risk of human error. Our system ensures accurate torque and drag data at the correct intervals, which you can configure to take place at each connection, at specific depth intervals, or when a survey is approved. Leveraging the system&rsquo;s high-resolution database, you can recalculate torque and drag values at any time for a custom data collection plan that meets your needs.</p>
