        <p>After 17 years in welding, Luis' then-manager tasked him with creating a training manual for all the welding processes. With 8 months and little direction, Luis chronicled every single process step—making a bias weld, loading the strip, etc.—to create the training manual. It was a success, reducing training time by up to 66%.</p>
        
        <p>But his work in training others didn't stop there. Luis became the go-to man for training at Quality Tubing, training not only internal people but also customers and outside welders on welding procedures and Quality Tubing techniques. This way, customers don't have to keep bringing back strings for repair or hire third-party welding companies each time. It's a value-add that gets baked into everything, starting right at the initial sale. The end goals of establishing these kinds of procedures are to achieve greater consistency and repeatability in manufacturing design and to enable the welders to do their job the same day that Quality Tubing receives the steel.</p>
