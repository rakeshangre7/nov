        For our employees whose work requires them to be onsite, we have implemented social distancing. We have also provided education about how they can protect themselves and their families by practicing good hygiene, limiting travel, and avoiding large gatherings. Staggered shop schedules, as well as rotating office schedules, allow us to continue operations with fewer people in our facility at the same time.
