      Value: NOV PowerBlade is an innovative technology suitable for drilling and hoisting systems. Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) are a proven technology widely used in Formula One racing vehicles and NASA exploration spacecraft for recovering a moving vehicle’s kinetic energy while braking and storing it in a reservoir (flywheel) for later use under acceleration. The NOV PowerBlade is a KERS system that preserves that lost energy to reduce fuel costs and emissions while increasing operational safety and reliability. PowerBlade is easily integrated into the power grid, and recaptured energy can be distributed as both DC and AC power

      Value: As an original equipment manufacturer with a deep understanding of our equipment&rsquo;s power distribution requirements, NOV has designed and manufactured drive systems for countless onshore and offshore drilling applications. With the largest selection of AC and DC integrated drive systems available to the drilling industry, our product lines for our AC drives and DC drives are highly reliable, improve performance, and are designed for the ruggedness of the oilfield. And with an estimated 80% of the installed customer base, we are the largest provider of SCR drives in the drilling industry. For customers looking to change out their DC technology and SCR drives with AC power with variable frequency drives (VFDs), we have a successful track record of installing and commissioning those upgrades.
