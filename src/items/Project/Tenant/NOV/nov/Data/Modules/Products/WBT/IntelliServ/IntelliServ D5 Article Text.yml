        <p><strong>Total</strong><br />
        We worked with Total E&amp;P Norge AS to optimize the Martin Linge project in the North Sea. We incorporated BlackStream&trade; along-string measurement (ASM) tools to acquire temperature, annular pressure, rotation, and three-axis vibration data at high frequencies from sensors embedded throughout the drillstring at regular intervals. These measurements were streamed to the surface in real time via the IntelliServ&trade; high-speed wired drill pipe telemetry network.<br />
        <br />
        Combining ASM tools with wired pipe and high-speed telemetry allowed Total to overcome the limits of hydraulics modeling. Accurately analyzing and understanding wellbore conditions at the bit and in areas such as the casing shoe was critical, while streaming visualization of downhole data optimized hole-cleaning monitoring, reduced nonproductive time, enhanced wellbore control, and sustained wellbore integrity.<br />
        <br />
        These improvements allowed safe increases in ROP and drilling of an additional 1,000 ft of reservoir&mdash;saving the drilling cost of one less well while still reaching planned production levels.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Statoil</strong><br />
        We worked with Statoil ASA to implement a suite of integrated downhole products and technologies on their Barents Sea Exploration drilling campaign of 2017. The package included BlackStream along-string measurement (ASM) and enhanced measurement system (EMS) tools and an equivalent fluid density (EFD) viewer, which worked with IntelliServ wired drill pipe and high-speed telemetry network to enhance real-time understanding of borehole conditions.<br />
        <br />
        The project ultimately proved that wired pipe was a viable technology as part of Statoil&rsquo;s digitalization and automated drilling strategy. Using the high-speed telemetry system enabled Statoil to raise the ROP limit by removing constraints on data acquisition while still providing confidence that the hole was being cleaned while drilling. The telemetry also significantly increased the quantity of streaming data for analysis and transmitted LWD-quality memory data in real time, which was critical in preventing a full packoff.</p>
