        <p>Luis began his career at Quality Tubing in 1989 when he went to the coiled tubing shop to get a job application for his brother and was hired on the spot.</p>
        
        <p>After starting out as a hydrotester for coiled tubing strings, he soon moved into the service department, spooling and respooling the strings. Fascinated with the mill, welding, and all the processes, Luis then convinced his plant supervisor to move him to the welding team. "I'd never struck an arc before in my life," he chuckled, "and then, I ended up working as a splice welder."</p>
        
        <p>Driven by his passion, a desire to do more, and a genuine interest in the advancements in welding and coiled tubing, Luis became "hungry." The bias line, which involved plasma arc welding, quickly caught his eye. Though at the time the process was a secret due to a pending patent, Luis' recognized skills enabled him to advance into plasma arc welding.</p>
