        <p>The TorqueMaster is a self-contained hydraulic makeup and breakout machine designed for fast, safe, and dependable maintenance of tools and motors in either workshop or drill site locations. The basic machine consists of a bed complete with a fixed headstock chuck, a moveable tailstock chuck that applies the torque, and a hydraulic console unit. </p>
        
        <p><strong>TorqueMaster power and product features</strong><br />
        The torque is produced by two hydraulic cylinders that rotate the tailstock chuck through a 30° arc. Breakout torque is greater than makeup torque at the same operating pressure due to the differential areas of the rod and head sides of the pistons. The TorqueMaster requires no anchors or special mounting facilities because the torque forces are resisted by the base frame.</p>
        
        <p>The headstock and tailstock each contain six radially arranged heavy-duty clamping cylinders. Each piston rod is fitted with a replaceable tong die. The hydraulic system is designed to move the work piece regardless of weight or diameter. The gripping force is in direct proportion to the applied torque, preventing damage to thin-walled components.</p>
         
        <p>A freestanding console contains the hydraulic power unit, operating controls, and torque gauges. The console has enough hydraulic capacity for the basic functions of the machine as well as a number of optional hydraulic accessories that make the machine easier to use and extend its capabilities.</p>
        
        <p>The operator controls the movement of the tailstock from the console, which allows the work to get done efficiently and safely. The tailstock is designed to carry a balanced load of up to 5,000 lbs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Torquemaster training courses</strong><br />
        Our TorqueMaster training courses are an ideal way for you to learn safety and maintenance procedures. These courses are designed for engineers, technical staff, and any other personnel involved with the use of the TorqueMaster breakout machine.</p>
        
        <p /><strong>Product Support</strong><br />
        We offer commissioning, training, calibration, repairs and service, upgrades and retrofits, and custom application for the Griffith TorqueMaster, the Peck-O-Matic bucking units, and all other units worldwide. Use the Contact Us feature to learn more about how we can support you.<p />

        <p>The Bowen&trade; Ditch Magnet is the best available and most effective means of trapping and removing metal particles from the drilling mud that the shale shaker will not get. This unit will capture all metals having magnetic attraction and hold them until they can be removed from the mud stream. The Magnet is particularly valuable during milling operations. Removal of mill cuttings and debris reduces wear of mud pumps and other equipment, as well as eliminating problems caused by the return downhole of harmful debris. They are equally effective during washover and fishing jobs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Construction</strong><br />
        The Bowen Ditch Magnet features simplicity, ruggedness and high power-to-weight ratio. The 36-inch long Magnet weighs only 90 pounds and will hold in suspension as much as half this weight of mill cuttings. The design is clean; eliminating trays, gates and other auxiliary equipment. The magnet is encased in stainless steel and has integral handles at each end for lifting.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Operation</strong><br />
        No special instructions are required to operate the Bowen Ditch Magnet. It is most effective when suspended by soft line in the mud ditch. It may also be suspended by soft line in the shaker discharge. The unit should be cleaned several times per day, depending on milling rate. Just remove the Magnet and clean with fresh or salt water hose. Wipe all cuttings from the unit and return it to duty. The unit may be cleaned less often during other operations when return cuttings come slower.</p>
