        <h2>Ultrafiltration module &ndash; process description</h2>
        <p>The ultrafiltration process is usually termed as &ldquo;dead-end filtration.&rdquo; Due to the inherent function-ality of all filtration systems, i.e. dead-end filtration systems, accumulation of sediments on the filter surface occur. The typical challenge is to remove these accumulated sediments, especially organic matter, as the most common reason for reduced functionality comes from biological foul-ing. Using the Seabox system for pretreatment to the ultrafiltration module significantly reduces this challenge, as biological matter is decomposed to a degree that it&rsquo;s more easily removed from the filter surface with regular backwash. No chemicals are required for this process.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Using the Seabox system as pretreatment allows for a low-maintenance subsea filtration process. Additionally, the backwashing capabilities enable continuous operation without the need for peri-odic chemical cleaning. The pretreatment of seawater in the Seabox module is essential in achiev-ing stable, long-term performance results.&nbsp;</p>
