      Value: "<p>The VXP liner top packer was developed for high differential pressures and is ISO 14310/14998 V0 certified. It is used for additional sealing of the annular space between the liner and casing. The VXP packer is activated by means of loading through the drill pipe and the packer actuator. After setting, the packer element is held in the desired position by controlled deformation of the support rings. In addition to the internal snap ratchet, the additional external hold-down slips keep the VXP packer in position so that displacements of the packer element do not occur with high differential pressures. The packer element of the VXP packer is available in various elastomers for different well requirements.</p>"
