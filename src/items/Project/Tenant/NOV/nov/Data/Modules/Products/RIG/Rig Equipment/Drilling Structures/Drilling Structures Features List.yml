        <h2><strong>Standard and customized drilling structure designs for application in any environment</strong></h2>
        <p>
        Whether it be dealing with extreme environmental conditions, designing a custom rig, or upgrading your current equipment, we offer a portfolio of standard drilling structure designs as well as the ability to customize a solution for your rig.<br />
        <br />
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Steel Toe Walking System</strong></h2>
        <p>
        The ability to drill multiple wells on a pad is critical in today&rsquo;s drilling industry. The Steel Toe Walking System moves your rig from well to well without wasting time rigging down and rigging up. The system consists of four lift-and-slide walking feet, modifications to the substructure, relocated drawworks, and system controls. The backyard integration items, such as cable management system, gravity mud return, high-pressure piping extensions, and choke recofingurations, allow a truly turnkey drilling structure solution. </p>
        <h2><strong>Drilling rig substructures backed by engineering power</strong></h2>
        <p>
        By combining rig designers and manufacturers such as Dreco, IRI, Continental Emsco, and DSI, we have the unique ability to provide necessary drilling rig substructure solutions for the most demanding and custom rig applications. With our substructures in service worldwide in every drilling environment, we offer a wide variety of standard designs as well as the experience and engineering power to develop innovative and customized designs. <br />
        <br />
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Derrick equipment built to optimize your oil rig</strong></h2>
        <p>
        We design and manufacture various derrick types for platforms, jackups, semi-submersibles, and drill ships. Whether supplying a standard derrick design or providing a newly designed product, each derrick is analyzed by our experienced team of structural engineers to optimize the design for its intended oil rig application, taking into account required capacities, specific equipment, environmental considerations, and third-party requirements. This allows us to create a solution that is tailored to realize its performance while minimizing the surprises that can occur in any given drilling structure application. </p>

        <h2>Drilling&nbsp;structure designs for application in&nbsp;any environment</h2>
        <p>Whether you&rsquo;re dealing with extreme environmental conditions, designing a custom rig, or upgrading your current equipment, we offer a portfolio of standard drilling structure designs as well as the ability to customize a solution for your rig. By combining rig designers and manufacturers such as <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=33A443A9DD9B4DC39F4378B1EBF9438A&amp;_z=z">Dreco</a>, IRI, Continental Emsco, and DSI, we have the unique background necessary for the most demanding and custom rig applications.</p>
        <h3>Offshore structures</h3>
        <p>We design and manufacture various derrick types for platforms, jack-ups, semi-submersibles, and drillships. Whether you need a standard derrick design or a newly designed product, each derrick is analyzed by our experienced team of structural engineers to optimize the design for its intended oil rig application, taking into account required capacities, specific equipment, environmental considerations, and third-party requirements. This allows us to create a solution that is tailored to realize its performance while minimizing the surprises that can occur in any given drilling structure application.</p>
        <h3>Land drilling rigs</h3>
