        <h2 style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe</h2>
        <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">IntelliServ™ is more than just wired drill pipe—IntelliServ is a technology enabler, a piece of the optimization and automation puzzle that allows data to be transferred instantaneously from downhole to surface. A massive increase in the speed and quality of data transmission—up to 57,600 bits per second—effectively turns the lights on downhole, allowing drillers to see things with clarity and accuracy in a way never before possible.<br />
        <br />
        Using IntelliServ wired drill pipe and its associated high-speed telemetry network means data-driven activities—like surveys, downlinks, and slide orientations—are performed in seconds versus minutes. Beyond these upfront benefits, the real power of IntelliServ lies in its ability to enable more effective integration of downhole dynamics measurement tools and drilling performance applications , which are used in parameter optimization and as part of a closed-loop drilling automation system.<br />
        <br />
        Imagine the possibilities as along-string measurement sensors collect data from deep in the earth and transmit it directly to the surface for analysis; as rigs begin to learn and algorithms adapt to changing downhole conditions. This is the future, and IntelliServ high-speed telemetry makes it possible.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">Net Cost Savings</h2>
        <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">In many drilling campaigns, using IntelliServ with select optimization applications and downhole tools eliminates significant time from the campaign. These days-per-well reductions can exceed the cost of wired drill pipe, delivering net cost savings per well.
