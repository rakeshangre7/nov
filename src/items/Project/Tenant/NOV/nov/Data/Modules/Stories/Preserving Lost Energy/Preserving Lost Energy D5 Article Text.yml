        <p>Heave compensation and tripping operations, which involve hoisting and lowering heavy loads over frequent and cyclic motions, are essential functions on a drilling unit that demand high levels of energy. These frequent and cyclic motions generate large and sudden variations in the drilling equipment&rsquo;s needs; the lifting equipment or winch both absorbs and emits energy, requiring energy to lift its load and releasing energy as it lowers it. This regenerated energy has been considered a burden to operation and has had no positive impact to the operation of the drilling unit. Historically, drilling units have not had the possibility to make use of the regenerated energy created when lowering a load.</p>
        <p>In response, NOV developed PowerBlade&trade;, an innovative energy storing and regeneration unit that receives and provides energy based on operational needs. This allows the rig to make use of the energy regenerated in a heave compensation or tripping operation instead of dissipating it through boiling water, thereby reducing fuel consumption, improving the environmental footprint, and boosting equipment performance.</p>
