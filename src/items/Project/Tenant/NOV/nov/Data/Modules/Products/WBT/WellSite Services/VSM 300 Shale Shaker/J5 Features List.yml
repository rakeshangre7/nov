        <p>As the world's first balanced, elliptical-motion, low-profile cascade shaker, VSM 300&rsquo;s use of integral secondary drying technology demonstrates our commitment to delivering cost-effective, environmentally responsible solutions to the oil industry. The VSM 300 is an extremely simple machine to operate, maintenance is minimal, and screen changing is carried out in 2 to 3 minutes by <em>one</em> operator.</p>
        <p>Supplied in modular form, the VSM 300 can be assembled on-site to produce multiple units, thereby reducing installation time and costs. The proven shallow header tank system provides equal flow distribution across the shakers, even when multiple units are installed. The VSM 300 can also be retrofitted to VSM 100&trade; skids. This significantly reduces installation costs on rigs on which VSM 100 shakers are already installed.</p>
        <p><strong>Features/Benefits</strong></p>
