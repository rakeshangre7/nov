        <h2>A story from a founding Derricks and Diamonds member</h2>
        <p>Michael Martin of NOV shared this anecdote about a year-one fundraiser the Derricks and Diamonds group held at the Westchase building.</p>
        <p>The fundraiser, Floor Wars, incited a friendly competition. On each floor, the committee placed a 5-gallon water jug and rallied for donations to the cause &ndash; with a slight twist. Dollar bills worked in favor for each floor donating, but change contributions were subtracted from that floor&rsquo;s dollar count. Michael described that you would have people throwing in their change to opposing floors water jugs so that their floor would stand a better chance of winning Floor Wars.</p>
        <p>On the last day of the fundraiser, the CEO at the time contacted Michael wanting to know how much money had been raised. Michael hadn&rsquo;t been prepared to share these amounts just yet, but when even the CEO is excited about the possibilities a grass-roots initiative can bring about, he knew he needed to act fast. He asked for members of the Diamonds and Derricks Committee to meet him at his apartment that evening so that he would have a total to share.</p>
        <p>One thing Michael and the group had not counted on was how difficult it is to pull dollar bills out of 5-gallon water jugs. Initially, Michael tried using a circular saw to cut open the jugs, but after this labor-intensive trial, he and others discovered a safer strategy of fishing the dollar bills out with a coat hanger.</p>
        <p>The group worked through the night, calculated the totals, declared a Floor Wars winner, and shared the final amounts with the CEO.</p>
