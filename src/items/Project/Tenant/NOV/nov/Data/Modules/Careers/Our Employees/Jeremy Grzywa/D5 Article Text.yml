        <h2>Into deeper waters</h2>
        <p>Growing up by the water in the Netherlands with a passion for physics, Fons Huijs knew he wanted to work in marine technology. After studying naval architecture at Delft University of Technology, he joined GustoMSC designing offshore vessels, jackups, and semi-submersibles and preparing drawings and calculation reports to demonstrate the safety and performance of the designs.
        Currently, most offshore wind technology is bottom-founded, meaning it can only be built in shallow-water areas like the North Sea at depths up to 50 m. However, Fons Huijs and his team of engineers have been designing floating wind turbines for deeper waters, such as those around the US.</p>

        <p>Jeremy Grzywa joined NOV immediately after finishing his bachelor's degree in business at the University of Nebraska. After a cross-country move to Houston, he rotated through different job functions within NOV before joining the product line management group within Rig Technologies.</p>
        <p>Just a few years later, Jeremy received an opportunity he couldn't pass up: managing the account of one of NOV's largest customers, an offshore drilling contractor in Singapore. For the next 4 years, Jeremy worked inside the drilling contractor's technical support site as the single focal point between the customer and the global NOV network to ensure the customer's needs were met daily. At the time, no other company matched that level of local support in the Eastern Hemisphere.</p>
