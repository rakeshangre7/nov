        <p>XL Systems provides both integral and weld-on connectors in sizes ranging from 16 to 72 in. in diameter. Oil and gas applications include conductor strings, surface casing, liners, and caissons.</p>
        <p>XL Systems is the sole provider of wedge thread technology for large-bore pipe. Integral threads&mdash;those machined directly into the pipe body&mdash;provide the advantage of a true flush OD and ID. We offer the following integral, wedge thread connectors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>XLF connectors</strong> &ndash; ideal for slimhole surface casing and liner strings where connector sealability is critical; and</li>
            <li><strong>XLC-S connectors</strong> &ndash; designed for strings where greater structural strength and fatigue performance are required;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, we supply connector products in which the threads are machined on high-strength forging material and then welded to pipe. Product offerings include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scorpion&trade; connectors</strong> &ndash; The latest in our compact class of connectors, the Scorpion&trade; provides robust strength and proven sealability in deep onshore wells and shallow-water offshore wells.</li>
            <li><strong>XLW connectors</strong> &ndash; A unique hybrid with a weld-on box and integral pin threads, combining the integrity of an integral wedge thread connector with the strength of a weld-on connector.</li>
            <li><strong>XLW-GT connectors</strong> &ndash; Using the same wedge threadform as XLW, the XLW-GT connection design includes an optimized, gas-tight, internal metal seal machined on pin and box forgings.</li>
            <li><strong>Viper&trade; connectors</strong> &ndash; Viper is a high-fatigue, fast makeup connector with a robust design suitable for the most demanding offshore applications.</li>
        </ul>
