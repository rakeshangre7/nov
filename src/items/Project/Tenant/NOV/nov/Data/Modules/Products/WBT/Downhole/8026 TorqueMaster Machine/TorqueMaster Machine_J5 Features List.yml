        <p>The TorqueMaster is a self-contained hydraulic makeup and breakout machine designed for fast, safe, and dependable maintenance of tools and motors in either workshop or drill site locations. The basic machine consists of a bed complete with a fixed headstock chuck, a moveable tailstock chuck that applies the torque, and a hydraulic console unit. </p>
        
        <p><strong>TorqueMaster power and product features</strong><br />
        The torque is produced by two hydraulic cylinders that rotate the tailstock chuck through a 30° arc. Breakout torque is greater than makeup torque at the same operating pressure due to the differential areas of the rod and head sides of the pistons. The TorqueMaster requires no anchors or special mounting facilities because the torque forces are resisted by the base frame.</p>
        
        <p>The headstock and tailstock each contain six radially arranged heavy-duty clamping cylinders. Each piston rod is fitted with a replaceable tong die. The hydraulic system is designed to move the work piece regardless of weight or diameter. The gripping force is in direct proportion to the applied torque, preventing damage to thin-walled components.</p>
         
        <p>A freestanding console contains the hydraulic power unit, operating controls, and torque gauges. The console has enough hydraulic capacity for the basic functions of the machine as well as a number of optional hydraulic accessories that make the machine easier to use and extend its capabilities.</p>
        
        <p>The operator controls the movement of the tailstock from the console, which allows the work to get done efficiently and safely. The tailstock is designed to carry a balanced load of up to 5,000 lbs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Torquemaster training courses</strong><br />
        Our TorqueMaster training courses are an ideal way for you to learn safety and maintenance procedures. These courses are designed for engineers, technical staff, and any other personnel involved with the use of the TorqueMaster breakout machine.</p>

        <p>The TorqueMaster&trade; 8026 unit is a self-contained freestanding hydraulically powered unit designed for fast and accurate makeup or breakout of threaded connections on drilling tools, tubular goods, and related equipment. The unit can greatly increase efficiency of offshore drilling operations and provides make/break capabilities that increase production offline from the drill floor. This way, the rig will spend more time doing what it does best&mdash;drilling.</p>
        <h2>A safe, customizable, and easy-to-use makeup and breakout unit</h2>
        <p>Following an industry-recognized practice for making and breaking tubular tool joint connections, the self-contained TorqueMaster 8026 runs off its own HPU, increasing safety and ease-of-use with by being able to be operated by one person.</p>
        <p>The full line of accessories for the TorqueMaster unit can be chosen and configured to suit your service and space requirements, making it a fully customizable makeup and breakout unit. It also has the option of being mounted on a lifting-certified skid, so it can be easily moved around the pipedeck with a crane to accommodate other equipment and operations.</p>
        <p>The TorqueMaster&rsquo;s flexibility enables rig personnel to adjust bottomhole assembly (BHA) and/or tool configurations on-the-fly and to respond more quickly and more effectively to changes occurring downhole. And by providing accurate information, the TorqueMaster unit ensures your critical connections are torqued to their required values and minimizes the possibility of a connection backing off downhole.</p>
