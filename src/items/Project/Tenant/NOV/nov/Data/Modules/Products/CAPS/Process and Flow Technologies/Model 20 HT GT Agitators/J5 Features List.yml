            <li>Quick and easy seal change capability that saves time and reduces maintenance costs&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Variety of seal options for application versatility&nbsp;</li>
            <li>High energy efficiency due to an optimized gear design and lighter weight shaft diameter requirements&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Standard cast dry well seal eliminates lubrication oil leakage from gearbox&nbsp; this design is superior to maintenance-intensive, unreliable lip seals&nbsp;</li>

        <p><strong>Internal Shafting<br />
        Features&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oversized low-speed shaft diameter and short bearing span&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Recessed low-speed coupling half</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Shaft Design<br />
        Both process and mechanical considerations determine shaft design. Shafts are sized to resist torsional loads and bending moments induced by hydraulic forces acting on the impeller as well as to avoid excessive vibration due to the coincidence of critical frequencies and operating speed.<br />

            <li>No need to pull shaft up through gearbox or in-tank shaft supports</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
        <div>Shafting is straightened to tight tolerances for long seal life and smooth operation less than 0.003 in. total run-out per foot of shaft length (0.25 mm per meter). Custom couplings, impellers, shafts, and steady bearings are available upon request, including sanitary designs.</div>
        <div><strong>Types of Shafts</strong><br />
        Shafting is supplied in a single-piece design or in rigidly coupled sections for easy installation. For large-diameter shafts, pipe shafting is a viable option, with couplings and impeller hubs welded to the shafting. A wide range of materials and coating options are available.</div>
        <div><strong>Couplings</strong><br />
        To facilitate assembly in the field, extension shafts are attached to the drive shaft with flanged rigid couplings, eliminating the need for shafts to be installed through the gearbox. Optional in-tank couplings can either be removable tapered bore or welded, simplifying installation of long shafts.</div>
        <div><strong>Steady Bearings</strong><br />
        Steady bearings are available to help support extremely long shafts. Cup tripod, bracket, and pad-type steady bearings are standard design options.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Extended keyways</strong> for adjusting impeller location offer process and design flexibility</div>

        <p><strong>Seal Features and Benefits</strong></p>
        <p><strong>
        Features</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drop collar shaft support during seal change </li>
            <li>Swing-out or spacer spool seal change designs </li>
            <li>Variety of seal options from major mechanical seal vendors such as John Crane, Flowserve, Chesterton, and AES</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shaft drops easily by loosening coupling bolts and engages by tightening the coupling bolts </li>
            <li>Shaft only drops &frac12; in., eliminating steady bearing disengagement </li>
            <li>No need to pull shaft up through gearbox or in-tank shaft supports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shafting is straightened to tight tolerances for long seal life and smooth operation less than 0.003 in. total run-out per foot of shaft length (0.25 mm per meter). Custom couplings, impellers, shafts, and steady bearings are available upon request, including sanitary designs.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Types of Shafts</strong><br />
        <br />
        Shafting is supplied in a single-piece design or in rigidly coupled sections for easy installation. For large-diameter shafts, pipe shafting is a viable option, with couplings and impeller hubs welded to the shafting. A wide range of materials and coating options are available.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Couplings</strong><br />
        <br />
        To facilitate assembly in the field, extension shafts are attached to the drive shaft with flanged rigid couplings, eliminating the need for shafts to be installed through the gearbox. Optional in-tank couplings can either be removable tapered bore or welded, simplifying installation of long shafts.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Steady Bearings</strong><br />
        <br />
        Steady bearings are available to help support extremely long shafts. Cup tripod, bracket, and pad-type steady bearings are standard design options.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Extended keyways&nbsp;</strong>for adjusting impeller location offer process and design flexibility.</p>

        <h3><strong>Seal Features and Benefits</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>
        Features</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drop collar shaft support during seal change </li>
            <li>Swing-out or spacer spool seal change designs </li>
            <li>Variety of seal options from major mechanical seal vendors such as John Crane, Flowserve, Chesterton, and AES</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shaft drops easily by loosening coupling bolts and engages by tightening the coupling bolts </li>
            <li>Shaft only drops &frac12; in., eliminating steady bearing disengagement </li>
            <li>No need to pull shaft up through gearbox or in-tank shaft supports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Shafting is straightened to tight tolerances for long seal life and smooth operation less than 0.003 in. total run-out per foot of shaft length (0.25 mm per meter). Custom couplings, impellers, shafts, and steady bearings are available upon request, including sanitary designs.</p>
        <h3><strong>Types of Shafts</strong></h3>
        <p>
        Shafting is supplied in a single-piece design or in rigidly coupled sections for easy installation. For large-diameter shafts, pipe shafting is a viable option, with couplings and impeller hubs welded to the shafting. A wide range of materials and coating options are available.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Couplings</strong><br />
        <br />
        To facilitate assembly in the field, extension shafts are attached to the drive shaft with flanged rigid couplings, eliminating the need for shafts to be installed through the gearbox. Optional in-tank couplings can either be removable tapered bore or welded, simplifying installation of long shafts.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Steady Bearings</strong><br />
        <br />
        Steady bearings are available to help support extremely long shafts. Cup tripod, bracket, and pad-type steady bearings are standard design options.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Extended keyways&nbsp;</strong>for adjusting impeller location offer process and design flexibility.</p>
