      Hint: description
      Value: |
        <p>Multiple nozzles are installed as part of the liner base pipe, screen completions eliminate wash pipe requirements and allow full customization based on the stimulation design. Our d-SolveTM nozzle features were designed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, real-world flow testing, and high precision dissolving technology.
        </p>
        <p>Each nozzle is equipped with an integral dissolving insert that was meticulously tested far beyond any requirements. The inserts don&rsquo;t dissolve until exposure to a known fluid for a particular timeframe.
        </p>
        <p>The nozzles provide access to the reservoir for stimulation and production operations once the timeframe is reached.</p>
