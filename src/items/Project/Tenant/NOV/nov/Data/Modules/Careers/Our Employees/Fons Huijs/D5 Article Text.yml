        <h2>Into deeper waters</h2>
        <p>Growing up by the water in the Netherlands with a passion for physics, Fons Huijs knew he wanted to work in marine technology. After studying naval architecture at Delft University of Technology, he joined GustoMSC designing offshore vessels, jackups, and semi-submersibles and preparing drawings and calculation reports to demonstrate the safety and performance of the designs.
        Currently, most offshore wind technology is bottom-founded, meaning it can only be built in shallow-water areas like the North Sea at depths up to 50 m. However, Fons Huijs and his team of engineers have been designing floating wind turbines for deeper waters, such as those around the US.</p>
