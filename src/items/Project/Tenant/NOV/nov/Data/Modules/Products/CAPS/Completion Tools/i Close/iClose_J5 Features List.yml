      Hint: description
      Value: "<p>i-Close is a sliding sleeve designed to be run in the open position as part of the completion string to enable communication between the tubing and annulus during deployment. This allows self-filling of the tubing and circulation during running in hole until the sleeve is closed. To close the tool, a dissolvable ball is dropped from surface and circulated to the integral ballseat in i-Close. Upon the ball seating, hydraulic pressure is applied to the tubing, and the sleeve closes. The activation ball used is typically made from a dissolving material that allows full access through the i-Close once the ball has dissolved. The design also enables the use of i-Close when a tubing tail plug or similar is installed below the i-Close, where a small volume sump is present below the ball after the sleeve has closed. i-Close has been tested and qualified according to ISO 14998 Annex A and D to grade V0. This means that after closing, the i-Close can be used to form part of the gas-tight well barrier between the tubing and annulus, allowing other completion or nippling operations to proceed without installing additional barriers. The i-Close can also be deployed in applications both in upper and lower completion strings in which an injection or production point is required, and it is desirable to be able to close it without intervention.</p>"
