        <h3>Advanced Sour Service Grade Drill Pipe</h3>
        <p><strong>HS<sup>3</sup>™ 125</strong>&nbsp;provides an extra 19% tensile capacity compared to that of previous 105-ksi Specified Minimum Yield Strength (SMYS) commercial grades. The controlled yield tool joints have the same strength that API specifies, delivering the full connection torque capacity.</p>
        <p><strong>XS<sup>2</sup>™ 95</strong>&nbsp;offers a completely SSC-resistant intervention and completion string. Intervention systems operate in environments that cannot always be controlled, and prolonged exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S may occur. With a weld area that is SSC-resistant, XS<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;95 saves time and money in deepwater applications.</p>
        <h3>Commercial Sour Service Grade Drill Pipe</h3>
        <p><strong>XD™ Grade</strong>&nbsp;is designed for the most severe H<sub>2</sub>S environments. Our XD grades feature restricted yield tool joints and a NACE TM0177 Method A tested tube for optimum fracture toughness, controlled yield strength, and restricted hardness. It is available in XD 95 and XD 105 with respective 95- and 105-ksi tube SMYS.</p>
        <p><strong>TSS™ Grade</strong>&nbsp;is a variation of our XD product, featuring a NACE-tested tube and API tool joints with an SMYS of 120-ksi. It is typically used in drilling applications in which connection strength is required and H<sub>2</sub>S embrittlement is well mitigated. We offer TSS 95 and TSS 105 with respective 95- and 105-ksi tube SMYS.</p>
        <h3>Customized Sour Service Grade Drill Pipe</h3>
        <p><strong>CYX™</strong>&nbsp;is a family of grades that enable end users to customize the drill pipe used to deliver their wells by changing a limited number of parameters: SMYS of tube or tool joints and the option to NACE test or not. Contact your Grant Prideco representative to further discuss your specific needs.</p>
        <h3>Sour Service Grades for Heavy Weight Drill Pipe (HWDP)</h3>
        <p><strong>XD™ 90</strong>&nbsp;is an ideal solution for sour service environments in which wear resistance, weight, and flexibility are required. Available for standard and spiral products, XD 90 material features a tempered martensitic microstructure for enhanced fracture toughness along with a controlled yield strength and restricted hardness.</p>
        <h3>IRP Sour Service Grade Drill Pipe and HWDP</h3>
        <p><strong>SS Grade</strong>&nbsp;is specifically designed and manufactured to meet stringent Canadian IRP requirements. These special alloy materials combine reduced carbon chemistries with advanced quench-and-temper processes for optimal SSC resistance, even in highly concentrated H<sub>2</sub>S environments.</p>

        <h2>Drill with confidence in harsh, sour environments</h2>
        <p>Drill string components are exposed to severe stress conditions when drilling challenging wells. In sour environments, there is the additional need to provide maximum mechanical performance without sacrificing H2S resistance.</p>
        <p>Due to limited sour service specifications, the industry has established mechanical and chemistry recommendations through organizational bodies like the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) and Canada&rsquo;s Industry Recommended Practices (IRP). Grant Prideco has extensive experience in manufacturing drill pipe and accessories for sour service applications, and we were the first manufacturer to meet stringent IRP requirements. </p>
        <p>Grant Prideco has developed enhanced materials and processes that deliver outstanding performance while resisting sulfide stress cracking. Built on extensive experience, we repackaged our offering into a comprehensive smaller product line, that will better respond to our customers&rsquo; needs. Selecting the right drill string is now easier with a line of engineered products that have optimized performance at every level of the NACE environmental severity diagram. </p>
        <p><img alt="NACE Environmental Severity Diagram" src="-/media/e789262f27804c85b493819e10425efb.ashx?h=650&amp;w=650" style="width: 100%; height: auto;display:block;margin: 0 auto 0 0; max-width: 600px;" /></p>
        <h2>Engineered Sour Service Grade Drill Pipe</h2>
        <p><strong>H2Shield&trade;</strong>&nbsp;grades maximize tension and torque in each of the three regions of NACE MR0175-2015 diagram of environmental severity.</p>
        <p>Region 1 and 2 grades are prequalified at plant level to ensure delivery of a product that will provide the right SSC resistance, with the shortest lead time and cost. This way, we guarantee the best and most economic option.</p>
        <p>For region 3 products, SSC resistance is so important that tests must be performed, and every order will be processed with NACE method A, solution A testing of the pipe and tool joints.</p>
        <p>We have simplified our offering to provide industry players a chance to align. To satisfy the needs of drilling engineers, we intend to place the correct grade of sour service pipe on rigs or with rental companies.&nbsp; Reducing combinations of grades will give pipe owners a greater chance of carrying the right grade.&nbsp; </p>
        <h2>Customized Sour Service Grade Drill Pipe</h2>
        <p>CYX&trade;&nbsp;is a family of grades that allows end users to customize their drill pipe by adjusting a number of parameters. This is particularly suited to operators who understand the balance between the need for strength and SCC resistance, and have run a risk assessment to define the fit-for-purpose product. This&nbsp; works best for long term development projects in well-known fields.</p>
        <p>We allow multiple meaningful variations on the pipe strength (from 105 to 125 ksi), tool joints (from 110 to 130 ksi), and options of prequalified or NACE tested components.</p>
        <p>Contact your Grant Prideco representative to further discuss your specific needs.</p>
        <h2>Sour Service Grades for Heavy Weight Drill Pipe (HWDP)</h2>
        <p><strong>H2Shield&trade; HWDP </strong>grades are available for standard and spiral products, designed with tubes that are stronger in tension than the drill pipe and with tool joints of similar strength to maximize the MUT of connections. These HWDP are offered in 3 grades that match the drill pipe environmental severity regions of the NACE diagram.</p>
        <p><strong>XD&trade; 90</strong>&nbsp; HWDP offers the strongest tensile capacity but reduced connection performance as a region 3 product.</p>
        <h2>IRP and Other Industry Sour Service Grade for Drill Pipe and HWDP</h2>
        <p><strong>IRP SS Grades</strong>&nbsp;are now integrated into our range of H2Shield&trade; products for region 3. They are specifically designed and manufactured to meet the stringent Canadian industry recommended practice (IRP) requirements. These use special alloy materials and advanced heat treatment processes to maximize SSC resistance for the highly concentrated H2S environments of region 3.</p>
        <p>Other specifications can be offered including the API specification 5DP sour service grades, TH Hill TS1 and Fearnley Procter NS1 sour pipe grades.</p>
