        <p>Since April 2014, the world&rsquo;s leading multi-national service company has entrusted the Elmar&trade; service center in Mumbai to deliver a consistently high rate of regional recertification success. Pressure control equipment requires major inspection and recertification every five years. The Mumbai center has been the cornerstone for providing fast, in-depth service to locations that may be hundreds of miles away.</p>
        <p>Typical lost time for remote recertification in the Middle East can add up to more than four months. Leveraging local experts for remote recertification has slashed this average by up to 10 weeks. As proof of success, the Mumbai service center has successfully recertified more than 600 wireline parts in the past 18 months alone.</p>
