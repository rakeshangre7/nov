        <p>The single wiper plug with integrated ball seat is attached to the setting tool and located in the first liner casing joint below the liner hanger. The hydraulic liner hanger is activated by closing the ball seat with the setting ball. Increasing pressure shears the setting ball with the ball seat and pumps it into the catcher underneath the wiper plug. The wiper plug serves as a barrier between cement and mud and is released by the drill pipe dart. The drill pipe dart and wiper plug are jointly pumped down to the landing collar.</p>
        <p>The single wiper plug with ball seat interlocks in the landing collar and thus enables an optimized drilling out.</p>
        <p>Features/Benefits</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ball seat located in the wiper plug reduces shock loading of the formation</li>
            <li>Saves time due to reduced ball travel</li>
            <li>High-strength design allows high bump pressure</li>
            <li>Anti-rotating mechanism to reduce drill-out time</li>
