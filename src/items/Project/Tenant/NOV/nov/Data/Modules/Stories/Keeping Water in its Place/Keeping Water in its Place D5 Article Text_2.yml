        <p>The Seabox&trade; SWIT&trade; technology offers a flexible solution that moves offshore water treatment from topside to seafloor while providing exceptionally clean injection water. This approach saves the cost, weight and space issues of topside systems and offers a modular approach to water treatment planning. Operators can adjust field drainage strategies as they go, reducing the uncertainties of planning traditional treatment systems within an industrial megaproject. This gives greater flexibility to optimize field drainage during or after investing in the infrastructure, aiding recovery of larger volumes of reserves.</p>
        <p>At depths of less than 500 feet/152 meters, offshore production platforms are commonly fixed to the seabed. Deeper water requires self-contained capabilities such as floating production storage and offloading vessels and tension leg platforms. Traditional topside treatment requires bulky equipment costing up to $70,000/ton/tonne and weighing thousands of tons/tonnes. These units require large amounts of deck space, leaving little flexibility for change as reservoir knowledge evolves during production.</p>
