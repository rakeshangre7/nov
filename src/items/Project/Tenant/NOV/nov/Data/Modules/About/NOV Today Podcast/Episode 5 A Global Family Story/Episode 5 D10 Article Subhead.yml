        <p>For many at NOV, helping our communities and each other in times of need often comes as second nature. It's a part of who we are and what we do. So when you read or hear the phrase "Global Family," what does that mean to you? For some, it meant life change. Listen as two NOV employees share their experience with this powerful idea that impacts us all.</p>
