        <h2>Maximizing efficiency, operation, safety, and maintenance  </h2>
        <p>Our DG degassers efficiently and effectively remove gases from gas-cut mud. This ensures the proper mud weight is pumped downhole, aiding in the prevention of blowouts. In addition, the DG degasser improves the performance of surface mud systems and increases operational safety by removing most entrained gases in drilling fluids immediately downstream of the shakers and upstream of any centrifugal pumps. DG degassers are engineered and manufactured to provide years of reliable service.</p>
        <p>DG degassers are skid-mounted, high-efficiency degassers with a Class I, Div. 1 starter and motor. The external JP-10 jet pump system pulls the gas-cut mud into the degasser and spreads it over the internal fiberglass dispersion plates (leaves) in thin layers, separating gas bubbles from the drilling mud. Liquid levels are regulated by float assembly to ensure the vessel maintains a safe operating capacity. A vacuum pump mounted on the skid or tank top then pulls the gas out of the degasser to be piped away for safe venting or flaring. The DG-10/12 NR-13 degasser also meets ASME requirements for pressure vessels and is stamped ASME &ldquo;U.&rdquo;</p>

            <li>Interior components coated with corrosion-resistant cold-tar epoxy for long part life with minimum maintenance</li>
            <li>Float-regulated liquid level in the degasser chamber ensures system will not overfill or run dry</li>
            <li>High-performance educator pulls mud into degasser, eliminating gas locking and allowing degassed mud to be discharged up to 20 ft (6 m) away, thus simplifying installation</li>
            <li>Vacuum pump located on each skid protects vacuum unit from damage and provides for simple maintenance</li>
            <li>Fail-safe secondary float and filler keeps mud from entering the vacuum pump</li>
            <li>Dispersion plates create thin sheets of gas-cut mud and bring entrained gas closer to the mud surface for easy removal</li>
            <li>Vertically mounted units enable installation in confined spaces
