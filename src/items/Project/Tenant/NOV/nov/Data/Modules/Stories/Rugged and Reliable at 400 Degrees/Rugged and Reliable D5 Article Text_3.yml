        <p>TracID helps ensure that successful life cycle management begins long before drill pipe arrives at the rig. RFID tags are embedded on drill stem assets to capture critical history, such as mill records, repairs and rotating hours. Collected data is uploaded into TruData&trade; &mdash; a comprehensive reporting management system &mdash; to ensure that the correct quantity, condition and grade of assets are delivered to the rig.</p>
        <p>The AutoTally&trade; component also delivers a 100-percent accurate drill string tally in real time. As joints are run in hole, a rig floor reader identifies assets and their individual histories, including rotating hours, and relays that information to the driller's screen. Maintaining an accurate drill string tally reduces the non-productive time (NPT) associated with missed depths, stuck pipe and twist-offs.</p>
