        <p>Steel pipe is often considered the product of choice for moving large volumes of liquid and gas over long distances, but there is a more reliable and cost-effective alternative: our Fiberspar Spoolable LinePipe.</p>
        <p>Understanding your needs, Fiber Glass Systems engineers developed a new line of spoolable composite products that expands application capabilities based on temperature, pressure, and flow rate.</p>
        <p>Fiberspar LinePipe is a spoolable product consisting of an inner thermoplastic pressure barrier reinforced by high-strength glass fibers embedded in an epoxy matrix. Intended for corrosive-gathering and injection applications, including general and sour produced fluids and gases, Fiberspar LinePipe can handle pressures up to 2,500 psi and temperatures up to 180 &deg;F in hydrocarbon applications (3,500 psi and 203 &deg;F in water applications).</p>

      Value: "<p>Pipe is supplied in continuous lengths up to 9,000 ft (2740 m) on reels for rapid installation in most applications. A wear-resistant exterior layer provides excellent damage resistance during handling and installation. Connectors are designed to grip a GRE structure, avoiding issues related to viscoelastic creep associated with thermoplastic materials. Connectors are available in all standard configurations (flanged, threaded, weld-end, etc.), or custom connections can be supplied.</p>"
