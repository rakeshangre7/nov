        <p>All of this creates a complicated contradiction, especially when well intervention service locations are far from the nearest service center. OEM recertification is required to do business, but the process to get documented can also lead to months of lost productive time.</p>
        <p>Recertification can be especially costly in remote locations, such as those found across the Middle East. In most cases, the only solution is paying high transportation costs to ship equipment to distant service centers, beginning an expensive waiting game that eats into profits.</p>
