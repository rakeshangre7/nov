      Value: "<p>Our High-Temperature Lock pumps extend the application range of progressing-cavity downhole pumps in high-temperature wells&mdash;up to 300 &deg;F (150 &deg;C)&mdash;that were previously thought to be out of the range of PC pumps. As a result of our extensive research and development as well as thorough in-field application testing, these proprietary high-temperature downhole pump solutions have taken multiple approaches to achieving the advanced capability of handling increasing downhole temperature levels.</p>"
