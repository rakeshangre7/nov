        <p>To encourage the safety culture, ongoing safety training programs are held with our employees, clients, and other stakeholders to meet their specific safety needs. Safety courses can range from computer-based courses on general safety tips to hands-on sessions relevant to a particular job function. To track training throughout NOV, the Achieve Learning Management System has been designed to enhance and support the global learning environment. Safety meetings and safety audits are constantly held to raise areas of interest and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
        <p>Other safety programs are created by specific businesses to encourage safe behaviors when performing everyday tasks. For example, the Rig Technologies D.R.I.V.E. (Driving Responsibility in Vehicles Everywhere) Program was developed to reduce auto-related incidents. This is an in-house driver improvement program that trains personnel on various aspects of driving, such as general driving, parking/backing, space, and time management. This safety program has proven successful with greatly reduced incident counts and has helped enhance NOV&rsquo;s safety culture.</p>
