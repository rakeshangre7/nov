        <h4>Explore how our Agitators reduce friction in sticky situations. Operators rely on our Agitators to optimize drilling efficiencies with 70,000 runs and counting.</h4>
        <p><strong>99.9% Reliability:</strong> Since 2012, the power section stator elastomer in the Agitator systems have demonstrated 99.9% reliability, globally.  According to data from our iTrax incident tracking system, only one stator elastomer incident per 1,000 runs has been reported since 2012. This means the elastomer power section in our drilling Agitator systems, is 99.9% reliable. </p>
        <p><strong>222% Increase in ROP:</strong> In Mexico, the AgitatorPLUS system paired with the FluidHammer achieve 222% increase in ROP, outperforming the previous RSS run.</p>
        <p><strong>$597,747 Saved:</strong> In Egypt, the Agitator system and MOCS tool save multiple trips, providing 20% faster ROP and 42% lower cost per foot than best offset, equating to huge cost savings to the customer.</p>
        <p><strong>50% Reduction in Drilling Time:</strong> In West Texas, the Agitator system was run in two wells in a test of drilling performance. In both cases, performance improved. Results: 70% increase in sliding ROP, 50% reduction in drilling time. This equated to $106,000 cost savings potential for the customer.</p>
