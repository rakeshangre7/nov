        <p>Drill stem troubleshooting can identify equipment that may be directly affecting pipe integrity. These trend lines lead to corrective actions that have been proven to extend the productive life of assets by as much as 22 percent, potentially reducing NPT by up to 30 percent.</p>
        <p>NOV recently conducted an extensive comparison of managed offshore pipe assets against their standard, non-managed counterparts in the North Sea. Final analysis showed a 55 percent reduction in connection damages for the managed assets, saving $2.7 million over 18 months.</p>
