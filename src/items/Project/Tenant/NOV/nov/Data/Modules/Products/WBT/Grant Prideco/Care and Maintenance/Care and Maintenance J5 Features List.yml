        <h2>Initial makeup</h2>
        <p>Even though connections are heavily coated with phosphate, thread damage is not always prevented. A generous and thorough application of high-quality thread dope (40% to 60% by weight metallic zinc minimum for drill collars or thread compound for rotary-shouldered connections) will help minimize galling.</p>
        <p>New connections that have not received factory make-and-break should be &ldquo;walked in&rdquo; with chain tongs. Always use the recommended makeup torque for the thread design. Exercise care to maintain calibrated torque measuring and indicating gauges for future use. After initial make-up and break-out of the connection, clean and inspect the threads, faces, and shoulders. Repair any minor damage. Relubricate and retorque the connection.</p>
        <p>Repeat make-up and break-out a third time before going in the hole. Monitor break-out torque; it should be the same as or less than the makeup torque. High break-out torque is an indication of problems, and the connection should be inspected for damage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Maintenance</h2>
        <p>Use thread protectors on both connections when handling drill stem products. Rotate breaks on each trip. Clean and inspect the individual connections.</p>
        <p>Qualified personnel should periodically conduct a magnetic particle/black light inspection. Drill stem products that are left idle or put in storage should be cleaned, inspected, repaired, and rust-proofed as necessary before installing thread protectors.&nbsp;</p>
