        <p>At times, it is necessary to connect from a floating rig to a deepwater subsea wellhead to use a conduit to retrieve the crown plug, intervene on the well, and/or perform well testing. Conventional large outside diameter (OD) risers are commonly used in these scenarios but can be bulky and slow to run. Using casing with premium connections is proven to be slow and expensive to maintain, as connectors are not designed to withstand multiple make-and-breaks. Opting for an intervention and completion string for (1) its compatibility with conventional drill pipe handling equipment, (2) its speed of makeup and running, and (3) its durability and resistance to a high number of make-and-breaks has proven to be the best option in various parts of the world. Our intervention and completion strings feature a near-flush internal diameter and a maximized bore, and they are designed to provide maximum opening.</p>
        <p>Our new Large OD product line enables building 7⅝-in. OD intervention and completion strings and increases potential drift farther than that available with 6⅝-in. pipe.</p>
        <p>The MaXit connection was developed specifically for these large-OD intervention strings. It is a gas-tight, double-shouldered connection with an inside diameter (ID) up to 6&frac14; in. It offers controlled makeup torque (MUT) to be rig friendly and features a fatigue-resistant thread form. The first MaXit 807 string came with a 9&frac34;-in. OD and 6&frac14;-in. ID for maximum drift and a controlled maximum MUT of 97,900 ft-lb.</p>
