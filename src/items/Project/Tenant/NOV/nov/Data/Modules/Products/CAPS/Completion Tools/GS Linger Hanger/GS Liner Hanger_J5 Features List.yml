      Value: "<p>Our GS liner hanger was primarily designed for vertical and slightly deviated holes. A special design that incorporates external slips means that large slip segments are formed, allowing high vertical loads to be achieved with the GS liner hanger. As the position of the slips in the GS liner hanger is below the cone, a trouble-free running-in is ensured. In set and non-set conditions, the GS liner hanger allows a very high bypass, so a high flow rate with low pressure loss is ensured.</p>"

A special design that incorporates external slips means that large slip segments are formed, allowing high vertical loads to be achieved with the GS liner hanger. As the position of the slips in the GS liner hanger is below the cone, a trouble-free running-in is ensured. In set and non-set conditions, the GS liner hanger allows a very high bypass, so a high flow rate with low pressure loss is ensured.</p>

        <p>Our GS liner hanger was primarily designed for vertical and slightly deviated holes. A special design that incorporates external slips means that large slip segments are formed, allowing high vertical loads to be achieved with the GS liner hanger. As the position of the slips in the GS liner hanger is below the cone, a trouble-free running-in is ensured. In set and non-set conditions, the GS liner hanger allows a very high bypass, so a high flow rate with low pressure loss is ensured.</p>
