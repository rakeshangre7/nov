        <p>While working, Luis got married, had kids, and even went back to school to earn an associate degree in welding from San Jacinto College. &ldquo;You really can go from the very bottom up to the top here,&rdquo; Luis says with a smile. &ldquo;You can go from a helper to leading an operation to supervising people. And I&rsquo;ve always been really proud of that.&rdquo; Luis pushed forward thanks to his innate drive and tenacity as well as the support of a company and group of people who had become family. Now, he&rsquo;s also working on training manuals for Spanish speakers, helping those in his native language with technical translations.</p>
        <p>People like Luis are the backbone of our business. Without them, we would have no products to sell to customers, no innovation to discuss in papers and articles. Luckily, after 30 years with Quality Tubing, Luis still enjoys what he does. &ldquo;This is what I tell my son: that you need to go work every day like it&rsquo;s your first day at work. If you can do that, if you can honestly do that, you&rsquo;ll last a long time.&rdquo;</p>
