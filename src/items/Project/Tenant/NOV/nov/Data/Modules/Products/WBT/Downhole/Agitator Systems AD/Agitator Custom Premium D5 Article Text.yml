        <h2>Premium Drill Pipe</h2>
        <p><strong>Pipe OD:</strong> Increasing the drill pipe size (like 5½ instead of 5") and upgrading the connection to a premium connection improve the string overall hydraulics as well as the annular one. This hydraulics improvement allows more flow and/or pressure to be delivered at the bit. The larger drill pipe size reduces the annular clearance, accelerating fluids outside the pipe to promote better hole cleaning. </p>
        <p>The drill pipe ID is the main driver of pressure losses in the drill string; it is the one factor that helps hydraulics, especially the tool joint ID. Selecting a more streamlined connection with a larger ID can lead to a reduction up to 50% of the pressure losses inside and outside drill pipe. </p>
        <p>Improved hydraulics give more available pressure at the BHA level for the motor, RSS, MWD, drill bit, etc. It also brings more flow to move the cuttings back towards the surface. If cuttings are evacuated faster, one can think that drilling could be faster.</p>
