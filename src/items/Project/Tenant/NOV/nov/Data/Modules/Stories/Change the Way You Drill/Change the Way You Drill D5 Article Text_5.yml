        <p>This ongoing project has the dual intent of providing significant and immediate value to the operator while developing lessons learned for future operational implementation and continued engineering developments. The eVolve team upgraded access to wellbore pressure information and provided the support to incorporate this new information into performance improvements across multiple phases of the drilling operation.</p>
        <p>Using this innovative NOV solution, Total E&amp;P Norge AS improved drilling in the reservoir section by using automation to safely increase rate of penetration and drill an additional 656 feet/200 meters of reservoir. The additional reservoir drilling saved the drilling cost of one less well while still reaching planned production levels.</p>
