        <p>Each Bulldog Frac sleeve is located with an active locating system, shifted, and stimulated by isolating the wellbore with a multi-set packer. Pumping down the coiled tubing annulus permits higher pumping rates and allows for better understanding of fracture geometry and dynamics. Our Bulldog Frac sleeve technology features a mechanical shifting sleeve specifically designed for horizontal multistage completions.</p>
        <p>The Bulldog Frac sleeve is activated using our proprietary Bulldog Frac BHA, which allows operators to locate, shift open, isolate, and stimulate each stage with the help of a multi-set packer.</p>

        <h2>Versatile, robust means of conducting an annular stimulation through Bulldog frac sleeves</h2>
        <p>The Bulldog&trade; frac sleeve is activated using our proprietary Bulldog frac BHA, which allows operators to locate, shift open, isolate, and stimulate each stage with the help of a multiset packer. Bulldog frac sleeve has a full bore and includes a large flow area, which allows operators to remove choke points for their production while maximizing stimulation flow rates.</p>
        <h3>Bulldog single-open (SO) frac sleeve</h3>
        <p>We developed the Bulldog frac single-open (SO) sleeves from our successful North Sea <a href="https://www.nov.com/products/i-valve-cem">i-Valve</a>&trade; technology, which features a mechanical-shift, single-open sleeve designed explicitly for horizontal multistage land applications. The Bulldog frac sleeve is activated using the proprietary Bulldog frac bottom-hole assembly (BHA), which allows operators to locate, shift open, isolate, and stimulate each stage with the help of a multiset packer. Pumping down the coiled tubing annulus permits higher pumping rates and allows for a better understanding of fracture geometry and dynamics.</p>
        <p>The Bulldog frac sleeve is compact, light, and easy to handle, which improves makeup times and reduces safety risks.</p>
        <h3>Bulldog multi-open/close sleeve</h3>
        <p>The Bulldog frac multi-open/close (MOC) sleeve technology features a mechanical shift and multiple open-and-close sleeves designed explicitly for horizontal multistage completions. This Bulldog frac sleeve is activated using our proprietary, coiled-tubing-deployed Bulldog frac BHA, which allows operators to locate, shift open, and stimulate each isolated stage. The sleeve, along with the BHA design, allows for flexibility with fracturing operations. Treatments can be performed as "open-frac-close" or "open-frac." The MOC feature permits closing sleeves later, should well conditions dictate.</p>
        <h3>Bulldog dual-shift frac sleeve</h3>
        <p>Our Bulldog dual-shift (DS) frac sleeve technology features a mechanical shift, multiple-open-and-close sleeve designed explicitly for extended-reach horizontal multistage completions. In most extended horizontal applications, a sufficient downward force is limited. The Bulldog DS frac sleeve requires only upward movement to open and close, providing a reliable means of stimulation.</p>
        <p>It is activated using our proprietary coiled-tubing-deployed Bulldog frac BHA, which enables operators to locate, shift open, and stimulate each isolated stage. The Bulldog frac BHA uses the proven <a href="https://www.nov.com/products/i-shift-hydraulic-shifting-tool">i-Shift&trade; hydraulic shifting tool</a> to engage each sleeve profile independently, preventing inadvertent closing of the sleeve. The unique design allows for future refracturing operations as required.</p>
        <h3>Bulldog annular frac-shifting BHA</h3>
        <p>The Bulldog frac BHA is bred from offshore heritage, using the field-proven locating and shifting capability of the i-Shift, teamed with our best-in-class coiled tubing straddle frac and abrasive jet components. The payoff is a modular, robust, and reliable means of conducting cost-effective annular frac stimulations. The Bulldog frac BHA is designed specifically for all land-based operations.</p>
        <h3>Bulldog ball-drop multi-open/close (BD MOC) sleeve</h3>
        <p>The Bulldog ball-drop multi-open/close (BD MOC) sleeve is a ball-drop activated multistage frac system featuring a mechanical shift, multiple-open and close sleeve designed for horizontal completions. Multiple sleeves can be installed in the completion string, with each sleeve opened with a specific size ball pumped from the surface. The multi-open-close feature permits opening or closing sleeves after the millout of the ball seat should well conditions dictate.</p>
        <p>The Bulldog BD MOC is an integrated part of the production casing or liner and can be used in both cemented and uncemented applications.</p>
