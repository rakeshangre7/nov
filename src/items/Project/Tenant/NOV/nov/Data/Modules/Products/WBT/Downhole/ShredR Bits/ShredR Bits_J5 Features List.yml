        <p>The TorqueMaster is a self-contained hydraulic makeup and breakout machine designed for fast, safe, and dependable maintenance of tools and motors in either workshop or drill site locations. The basic machine consists of a bed complete with a fixed headstock chuck, a moveable tailstock chuck that applies the torque, and a hydraulic console unit. </p>
        
        <p><strong>TorqueMaster power and product features</strong><br />
        The torque is produced by two hydraulic cylinders that rotate the tailstock chuck through a 30° arc. Breakout torque is greater than makeup torque at the same operating pressure due to the differential areas of the rod and head sides of the pistons. The TorqueMaster requires no anchors or special mounting facilities because the torque forces are resisted by the base frame.</p>
        
        <p>The headstock and tailstock each contain six radially arranged heavy-duty clamping cylinders. Each piston rod is fitted with a replaceable tong die. The hydraulic system is designed to move the work piece regardless of weight or diameter. The gripping force is in direct proportion to the applied torque, preventing damage to thin-walled components.</p>
         
        <p>A freestanding console contains the hydraulic power unit, operating controls, and torque gauges. The console has enough hydraulic capacity for the basic functions of the machine as well as a number of optional hydraulic accessories that make the machine easier to use and extend its capabilities.</p>
        
        <p>The operator controls the movement of the tailstock from the console, which allows the work to get done efficiently and safely. The tailstock is designed to carry a balanced load of up to 5,000 lbs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Torquemaster training courses</strong><br />
        Our TorqueMaster training courses are an ideal way for you to learn safety and maintenance procedures. These courses are designed for engineers, technical staff, and any other personnel involved with the use of the TorqueMaster breakout machine.</p>
        
        <p /><strong>Product Support</strong><br />
        We offer commissioning, training, calibration, repairs and service, upgrades and retrofits, and custom application for the Griffith TorqueMaster, the Peck-O-Matic bucking units, and all other units worldwide. Use the Contact Us feature to learn more about how we can support you.<p />
