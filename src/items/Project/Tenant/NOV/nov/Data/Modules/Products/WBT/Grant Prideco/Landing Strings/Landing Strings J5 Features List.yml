      Hint: description
      Value: |
        <p>Designed to provide higher tensile capacity, increased elevator capacity, and greater slip-crushing resistance, Grant Prideco&trade; landing strings are optimized to provide the highest possible tensile strength to enable running and landing casing and other heavy equipment on offshore wells, particularly in deep water. Landing strings are similar to drill pipe, with wall thickness greater than API specification 5 DP latest edition (specification for drill pipe), and they typically use a high-strength pipe.</p>
        <p>Landing strings are popular because of their compatibility with conventional drill pipe handling systems. This type of system enables higher running speed than alternative landing methods. Whereas traditional drill strings focus primarily on the ability to transfer drilling torque, Grant Prideco landing strings are designed to provide higher tensile capacity, increased elevator capacity, and greater slip crushing resistance.</p>
        <h2>Increased elevator capacity</h2>
        <p>As string weight increases, the load capacity can be limited by the string&rsquo;s ability to sit in the elevator. With the Grant Prideco SmoothEdge&trade; feature, the elevator shoulder can be made slightly wider without changing the tool joint OD.</p>
        <h2>Slip-crushing resistance</h2>
        <p>With an extremely high tensile load applied to some landing strings, slips have the potential to crush the drill pipe body when seated on slips. Large-diameter pipe is even more prone to crushing. To overcome slip crushing, one option is to increase the nominal pipe body wall. However, this greatly increases the weight of the string itself.</p>
        <p>A second option is to include the Grant Prideco patented Slip-Proof&trade; feature, designed to improve the fatigue life of drill pipe by reducing the effects of slip damage. Slip-Proof landing strings include a 70-in. section just below the box tool joint (where the slips are set) with an increased wall thickness. This feature helps the string overcome the danger of slip crushing with a minimal effect on the weight of the drill string.</p>
