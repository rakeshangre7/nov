        <p>M/D Totco’s™ KAIZEN™ drilling optimization application has continuous learning capabilities that enable it to provide proactive drilling dysfunction mitigation and maximize both rate of penetration (ROP) and mechanical specific energy (MSE) optimization. Employing artificial intelligence, it continuously evaluates drilling performance based on current wellbore conditions, compares it to offset well data, and recognizes environmental changes. This approach enables the KAIZEN system to instantly respond to changing conditions and provide optimal weight on bit (WOB) and revolutions per minute (RPM) setpoints.</p>
        
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <p><strong>Advisory mode</strong><br />
        Sends recommended RPM and WOB setpoints for the driller to implement</p>
        
        <p><strong>Control mode</strong>
        <br />Sends calculated setpoints directly to the autodriller
        <br /><em>In control mode, the KAIZEN system consistently achieves a higher level of performance than in advisory mode by continuously and automatically adjusting setpoints</em></p>
        
        <h3>Features</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Smarter with every foot drilled</strong>
        <br />Continuously learns wellbore conditions and related impacts of RPM and WOB on dysfunction and ROP</p>
        
        <p><strong>More than MSE</strong>
        <br />Digital twin models and machine learning algorithms ensure that applied set points are considering all wellbore dynamics, including:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Identifying drilling dysfunction and proactively mitigating stick-slip, bit bounce, axial and torsional oscillations</li>
        <li>Avoiding drillstring natural frequencies to minimize drilling dysfunction</li>
        <li>Real-time distributed stress analysis to check for buckling and over stress, as well as torque and drag</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>On-demand response tuning</strong>
        <br />Enables adjustment to tune performance towards ROP or MSE</p>
