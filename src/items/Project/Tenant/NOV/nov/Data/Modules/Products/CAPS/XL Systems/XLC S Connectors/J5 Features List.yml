        <p>The XLC-S is a second-generation integral connector with pin and box threads machined directly into the pipe wall. This design produces an ideal connector geometry: a true flush inside diameter (ID) and flush outside diameter (OD).<br />
        <br />
        Featuring a wedge threadform with enhanced strength and fatigue performance, XLC-S connectors are ideally suited for conductors and other applications where both structural integrity and special clearance is critical. XLC-S connectors have an external metal-to-metal seawater exclusion seal, which prevents corrosion in the threads.<br />
        <br />
        XLC-S connectors make up in approximately three turns, the majority of which are low-torque spin-up until the wedge thread surfaces engage. Makeup torques are comparatively low and range from 30,000 to 60,000 ft-lb depending on size. XLC-S connectors are suitable for makeup with either power tongs or manual tongs.<br />
        <br />
        XLC-S connectors have excellent field service history, successfully being used in a wide variety of offshore conductor applications since the late 1980s. XL Systems has completed extensive physical testing of XLC-S connectors, including full-scale fatigue testing and pile driving testing, and the connectors are manufactured in diameters of 20 in. or more.</p>
