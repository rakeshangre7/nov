        <p>As the most extensively tested large-diameter connectors on the market, Viper&trade; weld-on connectors are ideally suited for extreme-service conductor and casing applications. Available in 16- to 38-in. diameters, Viper connectors are rated at or greater than 100% of pipe body for internal and external pressure, tension, compression, and bending capacity in most sizes. The patented ViperLock&trade; anti-rotation device is easy to install and is reversible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A true multipurpose connector suitable for most applications</li>
            <li>Deepwater subsea well conductors or jet strings</li>
            <li>Platform conductors or drive pipe</li>
            <li>Jack-up exploratory well conductors</li>
            <li>Tieback conductors</li>
            <li>Intermediate and surface casing strings, including deviated wells</li>
            <li>Deepwater casing strings run in open water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Viper features a weld-on pin and weld-on box design. Viper connectors in sizes up to 34-in. diameter feature a near-flush inside diameter (ID) profile and an upset outside diameter (OD) that serves as an integral lift shoulder.</p>
        <p>Viper connectors have a dual-seal design: an elastomeric O-ring as the primary seal and a secondary metal-to-metal seawater exclusion seal. Extensive finite element analysis and physical testing have been used to verify performance capacities across the Viper product line.</p>
        <p>Two thread configurations are available. The Viper-1ST connector makes up in approximately 1.75 turns, and the Viper-3ST connector makes up in just over half a turn. Makeup torques range from 50,000 to 70,000 ft-lb depending on size. Viper connectors are suitable for makeup with either power tongs or manual tongs.</p>
        <p>The CAL I-E qualification requires the testing of two samples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first sample (ISO Specimen 1) is machined to an extreme tolerance, worst-case sealing configuration and make-and-break tested. Upon completion, seal performance of this sample is then verified through a series of tests that include two-quadrant combined load with bending (ISO Series B), four-quadrant combined load (ISO Series A), and limit load to failure.</li>
            <li>The second sample (ISO Specimen 5) is machined to an extreme tolerance, worst-case galling configuration. This sample then undergoes make-and-break testing.</li>

        <p>As the most extensively tested large-diameter connectors on the market, Viper&trade; weld-on connectors are ideally suited for extreme-service conductor and casing applications. Available in 16- to 38-in. diameters, Viper connectors are rated at or greater than 100% of pipe body for internal and external pressure, tension, compression, and bending capacity in most sizes. The patented ViperLock&trade; anti-rotation device is easy to install and is reversible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A true multipurpose connector suitable for most applications</li>
            <li>Deepwater subsea well conductors or jet strings</li>
            <li>Platform conductors or drive pipe</li>
            <li>Jack-up exploratory well conductors</li>
            <li>Tieback conductors</li>
            <li>Intermediate and surface casing strings, including deviated wells</li>
            <li>Deepwater casing strings run in open water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Viper features a weld-on pin and weld-on box design. Viper connectors in sizes up to 34-in. diameter feature a near-flush inside diameter (ID) profile and an upset outside diameter (OD) that serves as an integral lift shoulder.</p>
        <p>Viper connectors have a dual-seal design: an elastomeric O-ring as the primary seal and a secondary metal-to-metal seawater exclusion seal. Extensive finite element analysis and physical testing have been used to verify performance capacities across the Viper product line.</p>
        <p>Two thread configurations are available. The Viper-1ST connector makes up in approximately 1.75 turns, and the Viper-3ST connector makes up in just over half a turn. Makeup torques range from 50,000 to 70,000 ft-lb depending on size. Viper connectors are suitable for makeup with either power tongs or manual tongs.</p>
        <p>The CAL I-E qualification requires the testing of two samples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first sample (ISO Specimen 1) is machined to an extreme tolerance, worst-case sealing configuration and make-and-break tested. Upon completion, seal performance of this sample is then verified through a series of tests that include two-quadrant combined load with bending (ISO Series B), four-quadrant combined load (ISO Series A), and limit load to failure.</li>
            <li>The second sample (ISO Specimen 5) is machined to an extreme tolerance, worst-case galling configuration. This sample then undergoes make-and-break testing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Viper features a weld-on pin and weld-on box design. Viper connectors in sizes up to 34-in. diameter feature a near-flush inside diameter (ID) profile and an upset outside diameter (OD) that serves as an integral lift shoulder.</p>
        <p>Viper connectors have a dual-seal design: an elastomeric O-ring as the primary seal and a secondary metal-to-metal seawater exclusion seal. Extensive finite element analysis and physical testing have been used to verify performance capacities across the Viper product line.</p>
        <p>Two thread configurations are available. The Viper-1ST connector makes up in approximately 1.75 turns, and the Viper-3ST connector makes up in just over half a turn. Makeup torques range from 50,000 to 70,000 ft-lb depending on size. Viper connectors are suitable for makeup with either power tongs or manual tongs.</p>
        <p>The CAL I-E qualification requires the testing of two samples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first sample (ISO Specimen 1) is machined to an extreme tolerance, worst-case sealing configuration and make-and-break tested. Upon completion, seal performance of this sample is then verified through a series of tests that include two-quadrant combined load with bending (ISO Series B), four-quadrant combined load (ISO Series A), and limit load to failure.</li>
            <li>The second sample (ISO Specimen 5) is machined to an extreme tolerance, worst-case galling configuration. This sample then undergoes make-and-break testing.</li>

        <p>As the most extensively tested large-diameter connectors on the market, Viper&trade; weld-on connectors are ideally suited for extreme-service conductor and casing applications. Available in 16- to 38-in. diameters, Viper connectors are rated at or greater than 100% of pipe body for internal and external pressure, tension, compression, and bending capacity in most sizes. The patented ViperLock&trade; anti-rotation device is easy to install and is reversible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A true multipurpose connector suitable for most applications</li>
            <li>Deepwater subsea well conductors or jet strings</li>
            <li>Platform conductors or drive pipe</li>
            <li>Jackup exploratory well conductors</li>
            <li>Tieback conductors</li>
            <li>Intermediate and surface casing strings, including deviated wells</li>
            <li>Deepwater casing strings run in open water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Viper features a weld-on pin and weld-on box design. Viper connectors in sizes up to 34-in. diameter feature a near-flush inside diameter (ID) profile and an upset outside diameter (OD) that serves as an integral lift shoulder.</p>
        <p>Viper connectors have a dual-seal design: an elastomeric O-ring as the primary seal and a secondary metal-to-metal seawater exclusion seal. Extensive finite element analysis and physical testing have been used to verify performance capacities across the Viper product line.</p>
        <p>Two thread configurations are available. The Viper-1ST connector makes up in approximately 1.75 turns, and the Viper-3ST connector makes up in just over half a turn. Makeup torques range from 50,000 to 70,000 ft-lb depending on size. Viper connectors are suitable for makeup with either power tongs or manual tongs.</p>
        <p>The CAL I-E qualification requires the testing of two samples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first sample (ISO Specimen 1) is machined to an extreme tolerance, worst-case sealing configuration and make-and-break tested. Upon completion, seal performance of this sample is then verified through a series of tests that include two-quadrant combined load with bending (ISO Series B), four-quadrant combined load (ISO Series A), and limit load to failure.</li>
            <li>The second sample (ISO Specimen 5) is machined to an extreme tolerance, worst-case galling configuration. This sample then undergoes make-and-break testing.</li>
        </ul>
