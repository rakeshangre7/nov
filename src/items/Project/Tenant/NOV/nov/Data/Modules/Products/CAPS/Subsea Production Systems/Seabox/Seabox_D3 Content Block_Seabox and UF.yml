        <p>The Seabox module can be combined with ultrafiltration at the seabed. The combination will allow for removal of suspended solids with an absolute filtration down to 0.1 &micro;m. The disinfection and sedimentation capabilities of the Seabox module allow for effective use of ultrafiltration while at the seabed. The Seabox treated seawater will be supplied to the respective ultrafiltration trains, where the ultrafiltration is based on a dead-end filtration principle&mdash;e.g., all particles larger than 0.1 &micro;m are retained and will not pass through the filter pores. The quality of the filtrate will be consistent and independent of the feed water quality (suspended solids and turbidity loading). To maintain the flux through the filters for continuous production of the required quantity of filtered water, the filters are backwashed with filtered water. The filters are kept clean with backflushing only, and no chemicals are necessary due to the superior quality of the feed water from the Seabox module. The Seabox subsea water treatment module and ultrafiltration are controlled by Seabox&rsquo;s Subsea Control Module (SCM), an all-electric solution. This gives a unique control of valve operations and filter performance.</p>
        <p>The water from the Seabox&trade; module and ultrafiltration is well suited for matrix flooding, avoiding fracturing of the reservoir and preserving injectivity in tight formations.</p>
