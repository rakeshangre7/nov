        <p>A reduction in downhole tool trips alone allowed the well to be drilled two days faster than the previous well.</p>
        <p>In this same study, the battery on the high-speed downhole dynamics measurement tool achieved 240 of 250 hours of maximum battery life. This unprecedented 44 percent increase &ndash; up from 167 typical hours &ndash; was credited to TUNDRA MAX reducing bottomhole temperature by 22 degrees Fahrenheit/12 Celsius.</p>
        <p>Superior cooling reduced the amount of circulation required to lower the temperature of the well. The cooler environment gained an additional 1,000 feet/305 meters before equipment-damaging temperatures were encountered. Drilling restarted sooner and saved 51 hours of non-productive time. </p>
