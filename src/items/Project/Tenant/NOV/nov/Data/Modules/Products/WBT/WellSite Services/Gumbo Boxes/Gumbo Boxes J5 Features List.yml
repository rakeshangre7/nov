        <h2>Remove gumbo and improve solids control efficiency</h2>
        <p>Gumbo boxes are the first step in effective solids control when large, sticky, hydrated clays (gumbo) and other troublesome solids are encountered during drilling. Gumbo boxes use a motorized chain conveyor to remove problematic solids before they reach the shale shakers. The removal of gumbo and other solids by these units allows the downstream solids control equipment to&nbsp;operate more efficiently.</p>
        <p>The gumbo chain is positioned directly after the mud/gas separator at the flowline and is the first piece of BRANDT&trade; solids control equipment to mechanically remove solids from the mud.</p>
        <p>A cartridge assembly houses the gumbo chain(s) or scalper(s) that conveys the solids to be discharged. Gumbo boxes are available in three configurations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>5-ft (1.5-m) single cartridge</li>
            <li>6-ft (1.8-m) single cartridge</li>
            <li>6-ft (1.8-m) dual cartridge</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The gumbo chain uses larger hole openings than a scalper belt. Optimum chain opening sizes can vary depending on the formation drilled and the needs of the drilling program. The gumbo box is available in single or dual cartridge units that can be installed on nearly any rig.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Stainless-steel woven chain belt &ndash; Provides thousands of operating hours with reliable, maintenance-free service</li>
            <li>Option to use single or dual cartridges &ndash;Obtains the required capacity for your specific application</li>
            <li>Ability to handle flow rates up to 3,800 gal/min (14 384 L/min) &ndash; Facilitates quick processing of gumbo and other troublesome solids</li>
            <li>Single Gumbo Box has the option for left and right drive ends &ndash; Allows for installation with existing electrics and/or operator preference</li>
            <li>Dual Gumbo Box can be wired to a common junction box &ndash; Single point for electrical connection and maintenance</li>
            <li>Available with dual outlet and chain bypass options &ndash;Allows the Gumbo Box to be installed directly to the flowline without additional bypass valves in the rig flowline</li>
            <li>Can be provided with starters (optional) &ndash; Allows for isolation of one chain for maintenance or repairs and reduces downtime</li>
        </ul>
