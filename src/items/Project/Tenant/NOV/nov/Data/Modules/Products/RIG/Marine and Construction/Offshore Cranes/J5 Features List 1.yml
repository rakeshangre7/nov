        <h3>Offshore cranes</h3>
        <p>
        We know cranes are crucial to your daily offshore platform and vessel operations, which is why NOV offshore cranes are built for durability in even the harshest environments. Using decades of field experience and performance feedback, we designed a range of standard models to fit your offshore crane needs. If you require a custom application, we use the same expertise to deliver a reliable solution.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>
        Subsea cranes</h3>
        <p>
        Within our extensive range of subsea crane applications, each one delivered with a multilayer active heave compensation (AHC) winch system can be equipped with a Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS), which recovers system energy from vessel rising and block lowering while in AHC mode.</p>
        <h3>
        Heavy-lift cranes</h3>
        <p>With a lifting capacity of 1,000+ T, our heavy-lift (HL) cranes are primarily designed for offshore construction, with AHC hoist arrangements available for deepwater lowering. Special configurations are also available for windmill installation.</p>
        <h3>
        Other cranes</h3>
        <p>
        In addition to offshore, subsea, and heavy-lift cranes, we support selected domains such as offshore drilling with lifting and handling solutions, which leverage our broad technology base and provide unique value to our customers.</p>
