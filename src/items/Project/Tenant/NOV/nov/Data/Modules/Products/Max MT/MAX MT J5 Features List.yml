        <p>Max™ MT is next-generation maintenance software that integrates with our Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) data platform to allow customers to better understand their equipment and more effectively use preventive, predictive, and condition-based maintenance (CBM) practices we develop through data collection and analysis.</p>
        <p>NOV has been using and developing the Max MT platform for internal maintenance optimization for over a decade, proving its value. Building on this success and now accessible to external customers, the legacy platform's UI has been updated to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://portal.mynov.com/" target="_blank">Access NOV Portal</a> for increased ease of use and integration with other NOV technology products. The Max MT interactive dashboard allows real-time visualization of maintenance-related data by using notifications for asset condition and performance, providing the customer with data to make critical operational decisions. Max MT is not a bolt-on to an existing ERP, but offers immediate benefits as a standalone application.</p>
        <p>Anytime an NOV Max application is integrated, the data can also flow through Max MT, offering near limitless levels of customization. Ultimately, using Max MT as part of our broader condition monitoring, CBM, and total-cost-of-ownership programs positively impacts your organization's equipment economics and enables the transition to more effective forms of maintenance.</p>
