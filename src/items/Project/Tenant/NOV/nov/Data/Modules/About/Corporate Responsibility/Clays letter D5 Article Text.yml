        <h2>To Our Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>Every day, the thousands of individuals who collectively form our global family at NOV make a positive impact in both our industry and the communities where we live and work. I am proud of the role our company plays in helping meet the world's growing demand for energy and proud of the ingenuity and sense of service my colleagues continually apply to progress our organization and our industry.</p>
        <p>NOV remains a leader in the design, manufacture, and sale of equipment and components used in the energy industry by pursuing purposeful innovation and fostering a service-first culture. As that leader, we understand and fully embrace our responsibility to continuously improve our Environmental, Social, and Governance performance—both in our operations and in the products and services we bring to our customers.</p>
        <p>This means we are dedicated to providing equipment that allows our customers to work more efficiently while reducing their overall environmental footprint. We continue to pioneer technologies through increased levels of equipment automation and predictive analytics that take people out of the harm's way, help prevent operational issues, reduce waste, and drive efficiencies for our customers. In addition to our significant presence in the oil and gas industry, we also adapt our technologies to fit emerging alternative energy markets.</p>
        <p>As a global organization, NOV comprises predominantly local workforces. This diversity broadens our perspectives, strengthens community ties, and reminds us, over and over, that our greatest asset is our people.</p>
        <p>Our NOV family prioritizes ESG performance in our day-to-day activities, communities, and the products and services that we provide. I hope the drive and ingenuity of our team members will inspire you as much as it continually inspires me.</p>

        <h2>To Our Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>Every day, the thousands of individuals who collectively form our global family at NOV make a positive impact in both our industry and the communities where we live and work. I am proud of the role our company plays in helping meet the world's growing demand for energy and proud of the ingenuity and sense of service my colleagues continually apply to progress our organization and our industry.</p>
        <p>NOV remains a leader in the design, manufacture, and sale of equipment and components used in the energy industry by pursuing purposeful innovation and fostering a service-first culture. As that leader, we understand and fully embrace our responsibility to continuously improve our Environmental, Social, and Governance performance—both in our operations and in the products and services we bring to our customers.</p>
        <p>This means we are dedicated to providing equipment that allows our customers to work more efficiently while reducing their overall environmental footprint. We continue to pioneer technologies through increased levels of equipment automation and predictive analytics that take people out of the harm's way, help prevent operational issues, reduce waste, and drive efficiencies for our customers. In addition to our significant presence in the oil and gas industry, we also adapt our technologies to fit emerging alternative energy markets.</p>
        <p>As a global organization, NOV comprises predominantly local workforces. This diversity broadens our perspectives, strengthens community ties, and reminds us, over and over, that our greatest asset is our people.</p>
        <p>Our NOV family prioritizes ESG performance in our day-to-day activities, communities, and the products and services that we provide. I hope the drive and ingenuity of our team members will inspire you as much as it continually inspires me.</p>
