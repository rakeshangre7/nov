        <p>Our HT turbine agitators are robust, simple, and designed for ease of maintenance.&nbsp;<br />
        Our HT turbine agitator is available in 13 standard drive sizes from 1 to 1,000 hp (0.75 to 750 kW)&mdash;even more for specialized applications. A wide selection of mounting methods, materials of construction, shaft seals, shafts, impellers, and accessories can provide you with the best turbine agitator for virtually any process.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>NSF/ANSI 61 and NSF/ANSI 372 Certified</strong><br />
        This product is Listed by UL. Representative samples of this product have been evaluated by UL and meet applicable safety standards.</p>
        <p><strong>Chemineer&trade; HTM Agitators<br />
        </strong>Our Chemineer HTM is an optional gearbox for high-torque applications and is manufactured specifically for agitator service. Our HTM agitator drive is available in both right-angle and parallel shaft configurations, and it offers many of the same benefits as the HT drive.</p>
        <p><strong>Foot-Mounted Motors<br />
        </strong>Chemineer engineers have supplied nearly every imaginable power source for HT turbine agitators, including steam turbines, fluid drives, internal combustion engines, and others. However, the most common drive option is the standard, industrial foot-mounted motor. Easy to mount, align, and service, these standard motors are NEMA Class B in design with a 1.0 service factor and are available from 1 to 350 hp (0.75 to 250 kW). Speeds are synchronous with the motor used. Motor enclosures are either TEFC or explosion-proof and can meet ATEX standards and requirements. For severe chemical service, motors with Class F insulation and a 1.15 service factor can be specified.</p>
        <p><strong>Options<br />
        </strong>Variable-frequency electronic controls are available for applications requiring responsive speed changes. Tachometers, signal interfaces, and transformers are available. Variable-speed belt drives offer process flexibility with a three-to-one speed range.</p>
        <p><strong>Flexible Couplings<br />
        </strong>HT agitators up to 50 hp (37 kW) are shipped standard with flexible couplings for improved shock and vibration absorption. Other coupling configurations include gear couplings, flexible elements, and disc-type and fluid couplings.</p>
        <p><strong>Oversized Shafting<br />
        </strong>All Chemineer shafting is sized and tested to resist torsional loads and bending moments resulting from hydraulic forces acting on the impeller during mixing. We work with you to determine optimum sizing for your application.</p>
        <p>HT agitator shafts are available in diameters of 1.5 to 10 in. (40 to 250 mm) and afford maximum resistance to shock loads. All shafts are straightened to 0.003 in. of total runout per foot (0.25 mm per meter) of shaft length to minimize vibration and maximize seal life. Our experience with special applications enables you to specify practically any machinable alloy or protective coating suited to your process.</p>
        <div><strong>Types</strong></div>
        <div>Shafts are available in single-piece or rigidly coupled designs. Pipe shafting, ideal for large-diameter shafts, features couplings and impellers welded to the shafting.<br />
        <br />
        Extended keyways for adjusting impeller position offer flexibility in case your processes change. A variety of surface finishes provide protection in harsh service environments.</div>
        <p><strong>Couplings</strong></p>
        <div>
        Easier extension-shaft-to-drive-shaft field assembly is achieved with flanged rigid couplings with removable coupling halves or welded coupling halves. Optional in-tank couplings simplify installation of long shafts</div>
        <p><strong>Steady Bearings</strong></p>
        <div>Support of extremely long shafts requires the use of steady bearings. All Chemineer steady bearings have a replaceable wear sleeve that can be fabricated from a variety of materials. Both bracket- and tripod-mount designs are available.</div>
