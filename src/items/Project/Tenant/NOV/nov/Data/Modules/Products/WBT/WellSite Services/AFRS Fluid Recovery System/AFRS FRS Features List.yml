        <p>The BRANDT&trade; AFRS&trade; fluid recovery system by WellSite Services&rsquo; FluidControl group features a patent-pending design that processes drilled cuttings coming off the shaker from the wellbore, providing effective and efficient secondary fluid recovery.</p>
        <p>The AFRS system has two main purposes. First, the system recovers excess fluid that has generally been lost to disposal. The fluid can be processed and re-introduced into the mud system to reduce drilling costs. Second, the systems can significantly lower the amount of drilling fluid retained on the cuttings, making them stackable and reducing disposal costs&mdash;drier cuttings reduce (or eliminate) the amount of mix-off material required. </p>
        <p>Overall, the AFRS system has been able to recover up to 95% of the fluid that has been traditionally lost with disposal. Instead, fluid (effluent) is re-introduced into the active mud system. When drilling an 8.7-in (22-mm) hole, field data has shown that the AFRS system can recover up to .04 barrels (bbls) per foot.</p>
