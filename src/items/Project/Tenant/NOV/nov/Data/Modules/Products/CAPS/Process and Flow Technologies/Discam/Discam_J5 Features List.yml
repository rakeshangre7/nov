        <p>With the ability to capture up to 95% of solids at 5- or 9-mm aperture sizes, this innovative solution combines a self-cleaning screen with a high-torque grinder. No manual attendance or cleaning is required, and disposal costs for handling debris extracted by traditional screening processes are eliminated.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Discam is constructed using a series of shafts, two of which are fitted with interleaving cutters and spacers to give positive displacement solids grinding; the remaining shafts are fitted with overlapping and intermeshing discs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Easily retrofitted into existing sewage pump stations or inlet works as well as installed in new-build facilities, this high-performance package is suitable for almost any type of wastewater facility.</p>
