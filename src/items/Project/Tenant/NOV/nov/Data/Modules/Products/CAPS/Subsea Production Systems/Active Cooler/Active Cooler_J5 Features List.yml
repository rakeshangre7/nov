      Hint: description
      Value: "<p>The subsea active cooler is the first of its kind; its light, compact design offers a high degree of temperature control. It is a shell and tube cooler based on forced convection. The pump, motor, and power control configuration is the first qualified subsea design of its kind, in which the oil-filled motor is isolated from the pump by a magnetic coupling. The pump module, which includes a variable-frequency drive (VFD) motor controller, is designed for a subsea installation down to 3000 m. The motor is speed controlled, which makes it possible to operate the cooler within a predefined temperature range. The variable-speed drive (VSD) and control system is fully redundant and is qualified according to ISO 13628-6.</p>"
