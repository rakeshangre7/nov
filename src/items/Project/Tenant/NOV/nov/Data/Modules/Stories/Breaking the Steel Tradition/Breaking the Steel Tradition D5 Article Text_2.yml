        <p>The success of this phase prompted further weight-reduction solutions throughout the platform, with NOV suggesting a redesign of handrails as the next step. Approximately 4.2 km (2.6 miles) of the NORSOK-compliant MARRS® OFFSHORE handrail system, developed by engineers in NOV’s Pipex px® group, were designed for the platform. In addition to meeting the required strength, toughness, and fire-resistance performance and safety standards for offshore oil and gas installations as dictated by NORSOK, the nature of phenolic FRP materials enabled weight reductions over standard steel railing systems.</p>
