        Bowen Fishing Magnets may be run on wire lines or on pipe. Wireline operations have the advantages of speed and economy. Pipe operations have the great advantage of utilizing the generous circulation holes in the magnet to eliminate settlings above the fish, and to loosen the fish (see chart below). The first six assemblies (with sucker rod connections) do not have circulation bores.
        Bowen has Wireline Adapters available to run between the magnet and cable head or rope socket. When ordering, specify the required top connection and the magnet to be used with.
        The Flush O.D. Type Guide is sold as part of the assembly.
        Order by standard guide number, specifying type required and magnet to be used on
