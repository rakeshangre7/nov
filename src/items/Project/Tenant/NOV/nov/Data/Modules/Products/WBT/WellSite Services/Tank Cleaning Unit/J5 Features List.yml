        <p>The BRANDT Tank Cleaning System is comprised of two wash water holding tanks: one for the dirty water returning from the cleaning operations and one for the clean water used for jetting. The wash water is pretreated with surfactant before any cleaning commences. A Mono&trade; progressive cavity pump is used for supplying wash water to the jetting nozzles inside the tanks being cleaned, and a Mission&trade; centrifugal pump is used for creating a wash water circuit.</p>
        <p>This circuit is used to convey the slurry back to the system. The returned dirty water is fed through a decanter centrifuge to remove the bulk of the solids. The clean water is discharged into the clean water holding tank and is available for reuse. Upon completion of the tank cleaning, the wash water is chemically treated to separate the oil, water, and solids so that the clean water can be discharged overboard while only the heavily contaminated sludge is returned to shore for further treatment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Benefits</p>
        <p>&bull; Faster cleaning times &ndash; Less downtime</p>
        <p>&bull; Less personnel entry &ndash; Safer working environment</p>
        <p>&bull; Reduced waste &ndash; Lower disposal costs and environmentally friendly</p>
        <p>&bull; Can be used to treat slop water when tank cleaning is not required</p>
