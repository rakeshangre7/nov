        <h2>Proven for use in common MPD applications and land drilling operations.</h2>
        <p>The NOV MPowerD&trade; choke manifold 1500M/1500S is designed to provide primary finite control for balanced and underbalanced fluid return rates and wellhead pressure during MPD operations. Our choke manifold has been proven for use in common MPD applications and is most suitable for land drilling operations.</p>
        <p>Our easy-to-install MPowerD choke manifold offers simple operation and maintenance within a small footprint, which provides a cost-effective option for your MPD applications and overall ownership costs. Each of our MPowerD systems features robust designs, and the choke manifold includes these proven subcomponents: </p>
        <p><strong>HXE-G3 choke: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reversible gate and seat designed to direct high-velocity wear away from the positive sealing surface to extend choke life and reduce cost of ownership</li>
            <li>Customizable: Offers manual, hydraulic, or servo-driven actuator options and features 3-in. max orifice size (can be converted in the field to 2-in. or 1&frac12;-in. orifice)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Shaffer 2300 SFC manual gate valves</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Through-conduit gate valves are robust and easy to maintain </li>
            <li>Forged steel body and bonnet, bidirectional sealing, low operating torque, and manually operated (non-rising stem)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Titan C PRV</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manual reset relief valves automatically snap to a full open position when the set pressure is reached</li>
            <li>Position release button indicates, at a glance, whether the valve is open or closed </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Integrated bypass line</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Directs pressure and fluids safely away from personnel and allows the operation to continue while servicing the choke online</li>
            <li>Reduces or eliminates nonproductive time</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Ruggedized, simple control systems</strong></p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setpoint PLC local control panel monitors key drilling parameters such as pump strokes, standpipe pressure, wellhead pressure, and choke position simultaneously and continuously without fatigue</li>
            <li>Setpoint PLC local control panel automatically adjusts the choke as needed to maintain optimal annular pressure</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Manual hydraulic local control panel</strong></p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enables the operator to quickly respond to changing drilling conditions </li>
