        <p>Our custom-designed truck-mounted coiled tubing units are available in multiple configurations to meet your operational needs.</p>
        <p>Truck-mounted coiled tubing units are used in several areas around the world for several different reasons. Some areas have limited road systems that make it difficult to transport larger trailer-mounted units; other areas have smaller work areas at the wellsite that do not have room for larger units. Muddy, wet wellsites make it difficult to move trailer-mounted units into and around the site, and the same can be said for dry, sandy desert sites where soft sands can cause heavier units to become bogged down. Units are available in one- or two-truck configurations depending on the tubing capacity required and local weight and size limitations. Trucks are available in 6&times;4, 6&times;6, and 8&times;8 drive and even 10&times;10 all-wheel drive on a variety of truck manufacturers&rsquo; chassis, most commonly Kenworth or Mercedes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All hydraulic and electric power required for unit operation is supplied by the truck engine through power takeoffs and transfer cases built into the drive train of the truck. Operator control cabins are telescoping design for reduced road height during transport.</p>
        <p>Single-truck units are generally limited to a maximum of 14,500 ft of 1&frac12;-in. coiled tubing, while two-truck configurations can handle up to 16,500 ft of 1&frac12;-in. tubing. Depending on the design, some truck-mounted units come with an injector-handling crane mounted to the rear of the deck, whereas the two-truck design has the handling crane mounted on the second truck. Our HR-635, HR-660, and HR-680 coiled tubing injectors are available as required.</p>
        <p>We now have a unique split rail frame design chassis&nbsp;available&nbsp;that enables the tubing reel to be recessed into the truck frame. This unit will handle up to 18,000 ft of 1&frac34;-in. tubing, with a much lower center of gravity than conventional-truck coiled tubing units, and the chassis is an 8&times;8 all-wheel drive.</p>
        <p>We also maintain the proper certifications for import into all international markets, including CCC approval for China and RosTechNadzor permit for Russia.</p>
