        <h2>Designed and engineered for performance</h2>
        <p>We not only design and manufacture our own equipment&mdash;we use the same inspection equipment and proprietary software in our global service facilities.</p>

        <h2>Truscope A/S</h2>
        <p>Truscope A/S is a proprietary inspection system that combines ultrasonic and electromagnetic test methods for the detection of tube body defects. It consists of four separate inspection stations for optimum defect discovery and pipe-grade monitoring in oilfield tubular goods and line pipe: longitudinal, transverse, wall thickness, and grade.</p>
        <h2>TruPhase 360&deg;</h2>
        <p>Technology on your side. Oilfield tubulars with advanced performance properties demand a more sophisticated inspection method&mdash;one that goes beyond traditional ultrasonic techniques. Using 2D Phased Array technology, Tuboscope identifies pipe flaws at multiple orientations along with over 100% UT wall coverage and higher reproducibility than ever before.</p>
        <p>In a single excitation pulse, TruPhase&trade; 360&deg; 2D Phased Array transducers emit and receive ultrasonic sound beams at multiple oblique angles, detecting flaws at wider angular ranges. Combined with our proprietary Tuboscope recording and reporting software, we provide you a more complete analysis of your critical service tubulars.</p>
        <p>Both mill or post-mill inspection systems will be available soon, as well as a transportable system that can be used when site conditions permit.</p>

        <h2>TruScope A/S</h2>
        <p>Tuboscope's TruScope A/S is a proprietary, high-speed inspection system that combines ultrasonic and electromagnetic test methods for the detection of tube body defects. In a single pass, the system detects, evaluates, and classifies transverse, longitudinal, and oblique internal and external flaws as well as wall thickness variations and laminations. TruScope A/S satisfies the latest editions of API 5CT, 5L, and 5DP as well as other international specifications.</p>
        <h2>TruPhase 360&deg;</h2>
        <p><strong>Technology on your side.</strong> Oilfield tubulars with advanced performance properties demand a more sophisticated inspection method&mdash;one that goes beyond traditional ultrasonic techniques. Using 2D Phased Array technology, Tuboscope identifies pipe flaws at multiple orientations along with over 100% UT wall coverage and higher reproducibility than ever before.</p>
        <p>In a single excitation pulse, TruPhase&trade; 360&deg; 2D Phased Array transducers emit and receive ultrasonic sound beams at multiple oblique angles, detecting flaws at wider angular ranges. Combined with our proprietary Tuboscope recording and reporting software, we provide you a more complete analysis of your critical service tubulars.</p>
        <p>Both mill or post-mill inspection systems will be available soon, as well as a transportable system that can be used when site conditions permit.</p>
