      Value: "<p>The BlackBox Eclipse II samples and stores drilling dynamics data at 1500 Hz as opposed to 256 Hz with 2 Hz statistics, with the significant increase in speed enabling high-frequency analysis of acceleration data. Additionally, memory storage has been increased to 8 GB to ensure enough capacity for the high-speed data from a full run. The new tool offers operators flexible deployment options in their BHA or drillstring, with carrier sub sizes ranging from 4.75- to 9.5-in. OD. As an integral component of any optimization project, the BlackBox Eclipse II tool provides operators with a true understanding of downhole drilling dysfunctions, helping them optimize parameters and improve drilling performance on subsequent wells.</p>"
