        Our WBT-620 and WBT-660 models are built as transport trailers with two pressure vessels for transporting and unloading bulk cement and other powdered bulk materials. Our trailers are designed to deploy to wellsites and other locations loaded with powdered bulk cement or other bulk solids, such as fracturing sand. The bulk cement is pneumatically displaced to storage silos, batch mixers, or combination cement blending/pumping units.</p>
        <p><strong>Paint</strong><br />
        The paint system is shot-blast with epoxy primer and acrylic urethane top coat with choice of color and other finish details. Optional, organic zinc-rich primer is available for units operated in marine environments or other harsh operating areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Warranty</strong><br />
        Wilco WBT-620 and WBT-660 models are warrantied for 12 months from shipment date for repairs resulting from workmanship. Components for outside vendors including engines, compressors, axles, and suspension are covered by the original manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty.</p>

        <p>Our Wilco&trade; bulk cement transport trailers are built with two pressure vessels for transporting and unloading bulk cement and other powdered bulk materials, such as fracturing sand. With safety in mind, the transport trailers incorporate ASME-code pneumatic pressure vessels mounted in an open-frame trailer, giving them the lowest center of gravity on the market.</p>
        <p>Our trailers are designed to deploy to wellsites and other locations loaded with bulk material while maintain road weight regulations. Utilizing an integrated or offboard compressor the bulk cement is pneumatically displaced to storage silos, batch mixers, or combination cement blending/pumping units.</p>
