        The Texas Oil Tools DSV and DSU model over/under designs have two independent packers that are compressed by independent pistons.<br />
        <br />
        This setup eliminates the need for the tandem packer, reducing the overall stack height and ultimately saving you money by not having to buy lubricators. A pressure chamber between the packers can be used to inject lubricants or inhibitors during coiled tubing operations, extending the life of the packer.
