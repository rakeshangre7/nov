        <p>We are evolving pipe handling systems every step of the way. From drill pipe and drill collars to bottom hole assembly (BHA), casing, and marine risers, our pipe handling tools and systems can manipulate and connect any type of tubular on land or offshore.</p>
        <h2>Land rig applications</h2>
        <p>For the land rig market, we provide horizontal and vertical pipe handling with our series of PipeCat catwalk machines and the stand transfer vehicle (STV). Catwalk machines are designed to deliver tubulars to the drillfloor, and the STV racks tubulars between the fingerboard area and well center. Both tools are designed to remove people from dangerous areas and provide remote control of the operation.</p>
        <h2>Offshore vertical pipe handling equipment</h2>
        <p>Parallel column pipe racking systems represent the next generation of automated pipe racking systems. These machines provide the most flexible pipe racking configurations and capacities in the industry and can be integrated into newbuilds or retrofitted to existing rigs in applications ranging from large jackups to deepwater drillships and semi-submersibles.</p>
        <h2>Offshore horizontal pipe handling equipment</h2>
        <p>Our family of pipe handling systems consists of several options, varying from simple belt conveyors to semiautomatic pipe-handling cranes. We offer the safest and most efficient means for pipe and riser handling on static or dynamic drilling rigs. We also design and manufacture customized pipe-handling systems based on clients' needs and requirements.</p>
        <h2>Offshore horizontal-to-vertical pipe handling equipment</h2>
        <p>Our horizontal-to-vertical (HTV) machines are designed to deliver singles from the catwalk position to the vertical position above a mousehole for stand-building operations. Once a stand is built, the vertical pipe racker on the drill floor unloads the stands and either takes them directly to well center or stores them in the pipe racking board fingers.</p>
        <h2>Offshore pipe handling cranes</h2>
        <p>The main function of the pipe handling crane is to transport tubulars between the pipe deck and the catwalk by using a purpose-built pipe gripper yoke. The crane may also be used for other lift operations such as moving bulk equipment and containers, either by using slings from the pipe gripper yoke or attaching the optional chain sling with a hook to the boom tip.</p>
