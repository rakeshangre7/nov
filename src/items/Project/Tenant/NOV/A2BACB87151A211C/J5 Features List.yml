        <p>This integrated design presents a self-contained coiled tubing unit (CTU) for quick and safe rig-up with minimal personnel for the small outside diameter (OD) intervention market.<br />
        <br />
        This is accomplished by the ability to leave tubing stabbed into the injector during transport and raising of the mast on location. Our Hydra Rig&trade; bodyload mast CTU design minimizes the number of service personnel required while maintaining full operational functionality. This unit was engineered to meet the strict requirements of the California Department of Transportation dimensional and load regulations.<br />
        <br />
        This compact unit is engineered to hold our HR-635, 35,000-lb capacity injector and pressure control equipment (PCE) between the mast legs. These both attach to the mast and can be raised, lowered, extended, retracted, tilted, and horizontally shifted to the required position over the centerline of the wellhead. The stack-up is then lowered onto the wellhead for attachment. Also included inside the climate-controlled cabin is the CTES&trade; Orion data acquisition system, which can monitor and record your operations.</p>
