        <p>Manufactured from corrosion resistant Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites, our FRP ladders and gates provide the ideal corrosion resistant solution for offshore or chemical and industrial applications. Specifically designed for strength, durability and longevity, they&rsquo;re the suitable alternative to traditional materials, and are entirely built offsite allowing a fast track installation. </p>
        <p>Custom designed and built from standardized FRP structures, they can be fixed to walkways or inclined surfaces such as stairs.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lightweight, providing significant weight savings compared to conventional metallic materials</li>
            <li>Specifically designed for strength, durability and longevity</li>
            <li>Highly corrosion resistant &ndash;  long term integrity with minimal maintenance</li>
            <li>Ideal for provision of vertical access to all types of platforms and walkways</li>
            <li>Ladders include gritted rungs for maximum safety and durability offshore</li>
            <li>Safety cages can be provided as required</li>
            <li>Safety gates are available in half or full height, with intermediate bars to suit</li>
            <li>Self-closing gates as standard, latches included where specified</li>
            <li>Retro-fit designs available to suit existing steel handrails or ladders</li>
