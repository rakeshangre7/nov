        <h2>UK Rental, Sales, and Service</h2>
        <p>Based in Aberdeen and Great Yarmouth, NOV&rsquo;s Portable Power group supplies diesel-driven generators for rental in the United Kingdom for onshore and offshore applications. The fleet generators are built to rig-safe specifications. </p>
        <h3>Customizing portable power with proven, effective design and quality service </h3>
        <p>NOV container-based generators have inbuilt, ATEX-approved fire and gas detection/suppression as standard. The canopy-style generators are supplied with a stand-alone detection system if required. Ancillaries such as fuel tanks, cables, transformers, and distribution boards are also available to complement the generators. </p>
        <h3>Capital sales </h3>
        <p>NOV Portable Power&rsquo;s Capital Sales team is a global provider of specialized diesel generator packages for the onshore and offshore oil and gas and petrochemicals industries. The diesel generators are designed, built, and tested as project-specific packages in our Aberdeen facility to suit client specifications and requirements inclusive of legislative and environmental criteria. Our engineering team can provide a solution when selecting a diesel generator for the desired application. </p>
        <p>The service division can provide a full healthcare package for diesel-driven generators comprised of installation, maintenance, and repair of customer-owned equipment. </p>
        <p>Generators supplied for rental by Portable Power have the following features: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spark arrestor on engine exhaust outlet </li>
            <li>Chalwyn valve or Amot valve in line with engine aspiration </li>
            <li>External emergency stop </li>
            <li>Platform interface for ESD start and stop (24 or 110 Volt) </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Unit alarms and shutdown on:
                </li>
                <li>Low oil pressure </li>
                <li>High engine temperature </li>
                <li>Over speed</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Lifting certificates for unit, slings, and shackles (MPI and tested)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Optional fire detection, gas detection, and extinguishing system </h3>
        <p>The generators can have a Fire/Gas Detection system installed for certain applications: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat Detection</li>
            <li>Smoke Detection </li>
            <li>Gas Detection </li>
            <li>Fire/Gas Detection Panel </li>
            <li>External Controls and Status Indication </li>
            <li>Extinguishing System c/w internal and external pipework</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The installation of a generator set must follow certain rules, which must be strictly adhered to in order to get the equipment to operate properly.
        Highly skilled generator engineers carry out all works to ensure the safe installation and commissioning of your generator.
