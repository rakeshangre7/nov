        <p>The patented eXtreme Load CT-M&trade; connection is a high-performance version of our XT-M&trade; connection, the industry&rsquo;s first gas-tight, pressure-rated rotary-shouldered connection. The CT-M connection features the same radial metal-to-metal internal pressure seal for gas-tight pressure sealing capability and a shortened counterbore for improved structural integrity under high combined load conditions.</p>
        <p>The internal metal seal is generated by radial interference, drastically reducing the negative effects of tensile load. Capable of resisting high-pressure liquids and gas, the seal integrity is not affected by multiple make-and-breaks of the connection.</p>
        <p><strong>Features and Benefits</strong></p>
        <p>Grant Prideco developed CT-M 57 as a project-specific design on high-pressure completion tubulars for a Gulf of Mexico operator. It incorporates ultra-high-strength 135-ksi tool joints and was tested under combined load. Project requirements determined the load conditions, including an absolute pressure up to 29,000 psi and compression exceeding 200,000 pounds.</p>
        <p>CT-M connections are available in sizes from 2⅞ to 5⅞ in. and are not interchangeable with any other rotary-shouldered connections.</p>
