        <p>As horizontal wells become more prevalent globally, and as vertical wells reach greater depths, operators face more friction along the drillstring, which frequently leads to stick-slip situations. Common in North America, these well profiles are spreading into the Middle East, increasing the odds that operators in this region will encounter the same challenges.</p>
        <p>Across six continents, the patented axial oscillation technology of the Agitator system has provided unparalleled downhole friction reduction to improve drilling performance in conventional and unconventional wells. With more than 70,000 successful runs, Agitator&trade; systems have delivered tens of thousands more successful runs than any other friction reduction tool in the oil and gas industry. Compared to other industry offerings, the Agitator system provides up to 200 percent better ROP and as much as 50 percent less weight on bit. The elastomer power section is incredibly durable, logging a proven reliability rate of 99.9 percent.</p>
