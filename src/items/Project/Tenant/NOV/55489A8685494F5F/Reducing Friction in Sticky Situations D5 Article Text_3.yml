        <p>To envision how axial oscillation works, imagine a cell phone setting on an incline. When the phone is not vibrating, it stays stationary. Once a call comes in and the phone begins to vibrate, it slides down the slope. The movement breaks the friction between the phone and the surface it is resting upon, allowing the force of gravity to overcome the friction forces. The same principle works on a drillstring resting on the bottom side of a borehole in an extended reach operation.</p>
        <p>Incorporating the Agitator system into the BHA has enabled operators around the world to reduce friction and drilling time, saving operating costs. In Egypt, an operator experienced torque and drag challenges when drilling in complex wells. Using a 6 &frac34; in. Agitator system improved WOB and allowed the operator to drill an entire 8 &frac12; in. section in one run. Compared to offset wells without the Agitator system, the drillstring with the Agitator system saved half a dozen trips, increased average ROP by 31 percent, and reduced cost per foot by 42 percent, saving an estimated $580,000.</p>
        <p>An operator in West Texas used the Agitator system to reduce fluctuations in weight on bit and differential pressure on two wells, resulting in improved ROP and toolface control. The Agitator system reduced drilling time by 50 percent and saved an estimated $100,000.</p>
