        <p>In Mexico, one customer wanted to compare rate of penetration of a well drilled with an RSS to one drilled with an RSS and the Agitator system. Adding the Agitator system to the string resulted in a 100 percent faster ROP compared to the best offset well that ran an RSS alone.</p>
        <p>Another customer in Mexico compared the results of drilling a well with an RSS to drilling with an Agitator system instead. In this case, the well with the Agitator system improved ROP by 222% compared to the offset well using the RSS.</p>
        <p>Today&rsquo;s oil and gas landscape demands that operators drill faster and farther than ever before. Agitator systems break through friction and move operations along a path toward higher profits.</p>
