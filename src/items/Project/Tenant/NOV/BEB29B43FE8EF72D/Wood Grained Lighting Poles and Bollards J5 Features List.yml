        <p>Produced from environmentally friendly spun-cast concrete, our Ameron&trade; wood-grained poles and bollards have the look and feel of wood without the cracking or warping. We duplicated the wood grain lines in every detail, making it the ideal solution for pathways, western themes, and green belts.</p>
        <h3 class="J5-features-list__headline">Features/Benefits</h3>
        <p>Our wood-grained poles and bollards are available in several color stains to match any surrounding. The shafts are formed as a single-piece, square, concrete shaft with either a baseplate or direct embedded base. Centrifugally cast, our poles conform to AASHTO and ASTM-C1089 specifications. The luminaries are formed from high-quality cast aluminum and are powder-coated as required.</p>
        <p>After manufacturing the shaft, the aggregate is lightly exposed by an even coating from a steel shot blaster. Following the shot blasting, the shaft is coated with a pigmented concrete coating to enhance shaft color.</p>
        <h3 class="J5-features-list__headline">Colors and Finishes</h3>
        <p>Our wood-grained poles and bollards are available in cedar, walnut, and redwood colored stains. We offer Amershield&trade;, a premium graffiti-resistant coating, as well as other durable sealers and protectants that further enhance colors, protect the concrete surface, and aid in the removal of graffiti.</p>
