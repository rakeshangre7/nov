        <h2>Mortar and Grout Silo System</h2>
        <h4>Increase profitability with our lightweight and compact mortar and grout system
        </h4>
        <p>Blend consistency is crucial in managing the bulk handling of mortar, grout, cement, stucco, or other dry powders on a construc­tion site. The Wilco&trade; mortar and grout silo system provides new solutions to material blending and storage issues.
        </p>
        <p>Using pre-blended materials in­sures consistency and accuracy of blends, reduces waste, decreases on-site labor, and reduces the risk of injuries, all while increasing profit­ability.
        </p>
        <p>The compact size of our sys­tems makes for easy transporta­tion to and from the job site, as well as quick and easy setup, requiring minimal equipment.
        </p>

        <h2>Grout Bin</h2>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h4>Efficient and cost-effective &frac34; yard unit
        </h4>
        <p>The Wilco grout bin is field-proven and requires only two workers for safe and fast masonry block fill - one worker driving the ex­tended reach forklift, while the other operates the bin from either ground level or from the bin platform.
        </p>
        <p>This efficient transport vessel requires no setup time and is easy to own and operate. Once the job is complete, cleanup is quick and straightforward and only requires a basic water hose.</p>
