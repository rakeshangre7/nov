        <p>Our superior metal valve body is forged from high-strength alloy steel and engineered with superior geometry and toughness to give unparalleled performance in the most punishing applications. The combination of the valve body with revolutionary insert materials makes these valves the industry leader in lifespan and total cost of ownership.</p>
        <p>Our range of valve products are offered in snap-on or bonded valve types. Snap-on valves allow for polyurethane replacements. The bonded valves are manufactured with a multi-step process to chemically attach the polyurethane to the metal valve. The entire bonding process is automated to ensure a consistent coating for every valve. This process yields the highest possible bond strength for elastomers and will outlast other bonding methods in harsh environments.</p>
        <h2>Blue Thunder Valve</h2>
        <p>Our premium line of well service valves is designed to perform in the most punishing hydraulic fracturing conditions. The Blue Thunder&trade; valve uses a proprietary polyurethane insert with unprecedented wear characteristics that are designed to slowly wear during usage. The patented material is formulated to be chemically resistant and provides excellent abrasion resistance, good tensile and shear strength, and superior dynamic properties. The combination of our with our field-proven Service Master&trade; II forged-metal body exhibits properties that are superior to other valves.</p>
        <p>Applications include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>High-strength ceramic proppants</li>
        <li>Fine sands</li>
        <li>Sintered bauxite</li>
        <li>Diverter material</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Service Master II Valve</h2>
        <p>Our Service Master II valve is the industry standard for well service applications. Specifically, these valves are designed to handle proppant, cement, well service fluids, and acid. The valve has a full-open design for maximum flow characteristics. The standard polyurethane insert has a maximum temperature rating of 180&deg;F (82&deg;C), maximum pressure rating of 20,000 psi, and is designed to handle a low-to-moderate solid content.</p>
        <p>Applications include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Hydraulic fracturing</li>
        <li>Cementing</li>
        <li>Coil tubing</li>
        <li>Pump down</li>
        <li>Acidizing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Black Lightning Valves</h2>
        <p>Our Black Lightning&trade; valves are designed for increased toughness while maintaining high mechanical properties in the most challenging applications. Its unique composition and design increases resistance to harsh environments.</p>
        <p>Applications include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>High HCL acid</li>
        <li>Glycol</li>
        <li>High temperature</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Valve Seats</h2>
        <p>Any of our valve offerings can be paired with one of the Service Master II seats for maximum performance. The seats are made from a low-carbon alloy steel and are heat treated with a superior carburizing process. This provides a very hard, wear-resistant surface and a tough interior to withstand the repeated impacts that occur during operation. Each component&rsquo;s geometric profile and sealing surface have been optimized for a precision fit.</p>
