        <p>The BRANDT&trade; slider storage vessel incorporates the same discharge controls as the air conveyor. This unique flat-bottomed vessel with Slider Ram technology and an integral 14-in. discharge screw addresses problem areas that commonly affect conical-bottom tanks such as bridging, blockage, and reliability. The innovative design ensures discharge, even after extended periods of storage and settling of the vessel contents. The use of slider storage vessels greatly reduces crane lifts and ensures total containment of waste streams.</p>
        <p>The PLC-based control system offers unprecedented levels of safety and control in both manual and automatic modes. The operator can monitor and set the system parameters via the display. The discharge cycle is set by either weight and/or time. The optimum discharge rate is automatically controlled by the integral discharge screw, resulting in minimal operator interface and increased efficiency and reliability.</p>
