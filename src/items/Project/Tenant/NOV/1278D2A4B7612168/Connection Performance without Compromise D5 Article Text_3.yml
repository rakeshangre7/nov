        <p>The Delta connection has undergone extensive testing at NOV's research and technology development center, with early results conclusively proving that the new connection made up twice as fast as its predecessor. Damage was minimal and was primarily related to handling; generally, only refacing was required. For a final alignment on cost reductions, the Delta connection has the lowest royalty on repair services across all of NOV's double-shoulder connections. The Tuboscope business unit further supports the connection with lower charges to pipe owners and the inclusion of the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C1BBF8EE34934FD4AF7946895C3525E5&amp;_z=z">TracID&trade;</a>&nbsp;RFID-based tagging and inventory management system.</p>
