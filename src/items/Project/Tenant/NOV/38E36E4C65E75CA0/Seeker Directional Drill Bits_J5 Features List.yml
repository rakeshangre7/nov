        <h2>Optimize your drilling performance</h2>
        <p>Seeker directional drill bits combine the best attributes of MS and RS bit designs with several revolutionary new design features. The Seeker product line matches the bit to the specific well profile, drive type, and lithology by using the most comprehensive range of products in the industry coupled with our ReedHycalog&trade; SystemMatcher bit selection software.</p>
        <h2>Seeker S-Series</h2>
        <p>The Seeker S-Series is a ReedHycalog evolution in bit designs that provides a solution to increase the rate of penetration (ROP) in a variety of directional applications. The S-Series is a unique Seeker design maximizing open- face volume coupled with optimized hydraulics and aggressive cutting structures to deliver unsurpassed ROP in the vertical, build, tangent, and lateral sections.</p>
        <p>The S-Series is part of the directional drill bit fleet matched specifically to the well profile, drive type, and lithology using proprietary bit selection software for rotary steerable system and motor assemblies. The S-Series is designed specifically to provide the fastest directional bit for the application. The unique S-Series designs have proven field performance in areas around the globe and have been ideal for sShale pPlay applications.</p>
        <p>This product is offered in bit sizes from 4⅝ to 26 in. to be used in any directional application on a motor or rotary steerable system.</p>
        <p>Each Seeker drill bit is specifically designed for each drive type and well profile, providing a SystemMatched&trade; solution for each drilling challenge.</p>
