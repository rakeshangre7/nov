        <p>Specifically designed to overcome the limitations of purely hydraulic or mechanical drilling jars, the HMJ provides the advantages of both tools in one solution.</p>
        
        <p>Offering a hydraulic delay in the upstroke and acting as a traditional mechanical jar in the downstroke, the HMJ provides consistent firing regardless of the direction or temperature downhole. Internal mechanical latches allow the jar to be run in tension, neutral, or compression in the drill string. Additionally, these latches hold the jar in place during drilling and tripping operations, eliminating the need for an external safety collar and removing a falling hazard from the rig floor.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Performance</strong><br />
        To jar down, the drill string is lowered until the compressive force applied to the jar exceeds the preset mechanical latch setting. The latch releases, allowing the mandrel to accelerate to the fully closed position and creating a downward jarring impact. Raising the drill string until free movement stops indicates the latch has reset. The jar is ready for another jarring cycle or to resume normal drilling operations.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Griffith Drilling Jar Mechanical Latch</strong><br />
        All Griffith Drilling Jars (with the exception of the slim-hole 3½ OD and smaller) feature our mechanical safety latch mechanism. The mechanical latch firmly holds the mandrel in the neutral position in relation to the jar body, presenting any unaccepted jarring while making connections, tripping in or out of hole, or when tagging bottom. The latch is preset to release when either a tinsile or compressive force is applied to the jar and exceeds the forces seen during normal drilling operations. The latch release settings can be adjusted at the service facility to expand the range of the jar placement possibilities within the drill string. The latch mechanism allows the jar to run in the drilling string in tension or compression or at the neutral point within the range of the preset release settings.</p>

        <p>PCE developed the CARSAC HT (Combination Anti-Rotation Self-Aligning Connector – High Torque) to create a dedicated self-aligning tool string connector capable of withstanding high degrees of torque in both directions. </p>
        <p>The CARSAC HT assists with the tubing make-up when it is difficult to rotate the tools to engage threads and is particularly suited for long tool-string applications. It is especially useful when used in conjunction with integral ball valves and deployment bars.</p>
        <p>By incorporating the CARSAC HT in the bottomhole assembly (BHA), the string can be divided into smaller, more manageable sections. Each section can be torqued up accordingly before loading into the lubricator section. (The CARSAC HT matches the torsion yield strengths of all coiled tubing drilling thread connections for which high torque tolerance is a major consideration.)</p>
        <p>The locking taper feature enables each section of the tool string to simply stab-in and centralize before the torque drive teeth positively engage into the female lower sub. The primary locking collar is then screwed down to lock the two sections together. The secondary locking collar can then be screwed down to secure the joint and prevent the primary collar from backing off.</p>
        <p>The CARSAC HT is also a fundamental component of the coiled tubing deployment system. For applications in which the tool string length exceeds the capacity of the lubricator section, BHA deployment can be staggered by use of a coiled tubing deployment system. By running a combination of a deployment bar, dual ball kelly cock valve, and a CARSAC HT, the BHA can be deployed in multiple stages.</p>

        <p>The deployment system is an application work string used when the tool string length exceeds the capacity of the lubricator section. By using a deployment system, the bottomhole assembly (BHA) deployment can be staggered.</p>
        <p>The deployment system is a combination of three components: a deployment bar, a dual ball kelly cock valve, and a CARSAC HT.</p>
        <p>The diameter of the waisted section of the deployment bar is matched to the size of coiled tubing being used and retains full bore flow-through. Closing the ball valves in the kelly cock valve gives a double barrier to the wellbore. The CARSAC connector allows connection with the upper tool string without the need to rotate the work string. As rotation of either BHA section is not possible, the stab-in feature of the CARSAC HT is vital. The coiled tubing deployment bar system suits most applications and configurations of coiled tubing pipe rams.</p>
        
        <p />By running a combination of a deployment bar, a dual ball kelly cock valve, and a CARSAC HT, the BHA can be deployed in multiple stages as follows:<br />
        <ul>
        <li>Make-up the lower BHA assy to the deployment system and position it in the lubricator.</li>
        <li>Connect the upper (male) section of the CARSAC, check valve, and connector to coiled tubing.</li>
        <li>Lower the upper string onto the lower BHA section and connect via the CARSAC.</li>
        <li>Lower the BHA section below the blowout preventer (BOP) and close the pipe rams around the deployment bar, creating a seal between the well and surface.</li>
        <li>Close the ball valves on the dual ball kelly cock and bleed off the remaining pressure in the upper string.</li>
        <li>Separate the CARSAC, leaving the female lower sub facing upwards.</li>
        <li>Make-up the remaining BHA with upper male section of CARSAC and stab into the lower BHA section.</li>
        <li>Open the BOP pipe rams, and the complete BHA can then be run in hole. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When ordering deployment systems, please specify size, thread connection, waisted to suit BOP diameter, and length of reduced diameter.</p>
