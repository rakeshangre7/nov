        <p>NOV has delivered the next generation of measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools with the iSeries™ NXT platform from our Tolteq™ family of directional systems. The NXT platform enhances the capabilities of the proven iSeries platform with new capabilities that can support your ever-growing measurement requirements and enable real-time drilling optimization for your operations.<br />
        <br />
        Together with the recently developed near-bit measurement sub (iNBS) and the symmetric propagation resistivity (SPR) logging-while-drilling (LWD) tool, the drilling optimization capabilities provided by NXT solidify the Tolteq iSeries as the industry-standard platform in MWD technology.  <br />
        <br />
        Our NXT tools are compatible with legacy iSeries tools, enabling the use of existing tool fleets to provide the following additional NXT capabilities with limited investment: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p />
        <ul>
        <li>iSeries NXT directional module features such as continuous inclination and azimuth and stick-slip detection*</li>
        <li>iSeries NXT top-mounted pulser delivers faster data rates while providing increased shock and vibration resistance with a fixed-mount design</li>
        <li>iSeries NXT PWD sensor is available with the top-mount pulser for real-time measurements of annular and internal bore pressure while drilling</li>
        <li>iiSeries NXT retrievable pulser features faster data rates and the addition of nearmotor sensors*</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Tolteq iSeries tools are the leading probe-based mud-pulse MWD tools. With more than 600 tools in operation, the iSeries platform is recognized for its reliability, low operating costs, and user-friendly operation and maintenance.<br />
        *Pending release</p>
