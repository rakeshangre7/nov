        <h2>Combat corrosion with superior coating performance</h2>
        <p>Protecting sucker rods is critical to efficient services in highly corrosive environments and harsh pumping conditions. Tuboscope sucker rod coatings for corrosion protection are proven to extend your rod string's life in downhole environments.</p>
        <p>Our stainless steel/epoxy coating (SS/EC) integrates a sprayed stainless steel barrier with epoxy top-coated resins to deliver record-breaking performance in the most abrasive well conditions. The SS/EC double-strength interlocking shield protects against downhole corrosion while resisting the abuse of everyday oilfield handling. Tuboscope SS/EC rods balance durability with flexibility to consistently outlast the competition.</p>
        <h2>Modified epoxy</h2>
        <p>As the premier choice for high-volume, hard-to-treat wells, modified epoxy coating protects guided sucker rods from corrosion due to turbulent flow. Modified epoxy returns your used rod to service faster than the competition, reducing downtime and rod pulling costs due to failure.</p>
        <h2>Stainless steel</h2>
        <p>Stainless steel coating protection increases rod string life six to 10 times in severe cases. Its flexible design enables operation in CO2, limited H2S, and saltwater service with no special handling required&mdash;simply use API recommended practice for a bare rod. With the durability to handle incidental abrasion and mechanical contact, stainless steel offers superior chemical resistance for your sucker rod.</p>
        <h2>TK-SMP: A new type of external coating</h2>
        <p>Internally developed by Tuboscope as a hybrid external coating, TK&trade;-SMP combines the anti-wear and corrosion advantages of metallic coating with the capabilities of liquid organic coating to offer revolutionary sucker rod and coating performance. To ensure reliable services, TK-SMP is purposefully designed for temperature performance, flexibility in harsh environments, and chemical and wear resistance.</p>
