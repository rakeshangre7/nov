      Value: |
        <p>Our leak-free stuffing boxes ensure complete sealing by providing simultaneous dynamic and static sealing with the added protection of a gas exclusion system and optional leak monitoring/indicating equipment. Produced fluids are routed down the flowline, keeping them off the wellhead and, most importantly, off the ground.</p>
        <h2>Dynamic sealing</h2>
        <p>This stuffing box system provides critical environmental protection while guarding the stuffing boxes' internal components from contamination. It is available in two configurations: dual-mechanical seal (DMS) and triple-lip seal (TLS).</p>
        <h2>Static sealing</h2>
        <p>A Z-Seal packing arrangement maintains a continuous seal between the polished rod and the stuffing box shaft as they rotate in unison.</p>
        <h2>Gas exclusion</h2>
        <p>An integrated oil-filled standpipe and roto glyd ring are fitted to each leak-free stuffing box to prevent gas ingress.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Twin-bearing arrangement that isolates the seal package from polished rod side loading and misalignment</li>
            <li>Available as integral (direct connection to the drive head) or retrofit (using a booth)</li>
            <li>Easy fitting of the cartridge-style seal carrier stack</li>
            <li>Seal package is mechanically locked in the housing cavity for proper performance</li>
            <li>Positive keyed drive of seal sleeve</li>
            <li>Internal standpipe added to divert produced gases away from dynamic sealing faces</li>
            <li>All static O-rings made of FPM</li>
