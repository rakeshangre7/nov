        <p>Anson™ pressure relief valves (PRV), sometimes referred to as “pop off valves,” are designed to protect against overpressure from pump supply in the flowline. The valve is set to open at a preset pressure. Hydraulic pressure in the system acts directly on the ball and seat arrangement of the valve. When the system is at or below the set pressure, the ball will remain seated checking flow. Once the line pressure becomes greater than the set pressure, the ball will begin to unseat and relieve pressure through the outlet branch. The valve is self-resetting, and the disc spring arrangement provides a fast reseating action once overpressure has been relieved.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We manufacture relief valves for working pressures of up to 15,000 psi (Fig 2202 Sour Service) and 20,000 psi (Fig 2002 Standard Service).</p>
