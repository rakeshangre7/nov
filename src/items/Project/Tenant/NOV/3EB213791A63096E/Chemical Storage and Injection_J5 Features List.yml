      Hint: description
      Value: "<p>Subsea storage units (SSUs) have been developed to be used to store chemicals (i.e., monoethylene glycol [MEG]) to provide an economic and effective solution for subsea fields. Using a chemical storage and injection unit to store MEG eliminates the need for an MEG flowline on a cooled-down manifold when the production has been shut down or in remote fields where mile-long flowlines present their own challenges. This adds considerable flexibility to operators, and it is a prime enabler for long tieback solutions in brownfields.</p>"

        <ul>
            <li>Separation of stored medium and seawater</li>
            <li>Collapsible bag offers opportunity for low-cost installation of relatively large units</li>
            <li>Enables technology for Arctic, subsea processing, and remote fields unaffected by extreme weather conditions</li>
            <li>Radical reduction in umbilical complexity, decreasing umbilical capital expenditure (CAPEX), installation time, and cost</li>
            <li>Removes practical and flow assurance challenges with long supply lines</li>
            <li>Local storage close to consumer to avoid sizing the umbilical for solitary events (start/stop inhibits)</li>
            <li>Reduces topside load (space/weight) by moving MEG storage subsea</li>
            <li>Enhances platform safety; represents a remote subsea storage system that will not cause a potential platform fire and explosion</li>
        </ul>
