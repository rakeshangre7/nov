        <p>Traditionally, the operator of a wireline logging truck has as little as 18&deg; of vision, but the iMaxx wireline truck provides operators with the industry&rsquo;s most expansive range of vision on the market: 176&deg;.<br />
        This new pump-down wireline logging truck has an innovative window design that delivers an unprecedented panoramic view. In addition to the full, front observation window, there are large side windows and an extra-large skylight window for viewing grease heads, top sheaves, and more. To address the additional solar heat that can enter the cabin through these large windows, we use Laminated Saflex&reg; SG solar interlayer glass.</p>
        <p>With 24/7 operating conditions, special efforts have been made toward operator comfort with the addition of a high-quality powered captain&rsquo;s chair.</p>
        <p>-<span> </span>Powered lumbar support<br />
        -<span> </span>Six-way powered adjustable base<br />

        -<span> </span>Perforated inserts<br />

        <p>In conjunction with the upgrades built into our iMaxx pump-down logging truck, all familiar features required for traditional wireline and logging activities are still available (customer&rsquo;s choice of chassis, variable logging speeds, etc.).</p>
