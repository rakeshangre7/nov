        <p>Anoxic Mixers are used in de-nitrification basins in wastewater treatment plants. The process involves the de-nitrification of waste streams with bacteria, breaking down the nitrate in the waste to use as an oxygen source. This breakdown of nitrate from the waste stream releases oxygen and nitrogen gas. The oxygen is then consumed by the bacteria and the nitrogen gas releases into the atmosphere. Once the waste stream has acceptable nitrogen levels, the water can be discharged into the environment (streams, ponds, lakes, etc.). </p>
        <p>The basin is mixed but is not aerated, as the goal is for the bacteria to break down the nitrate to provide oxygen, rather than the dissolved oxygen in the waste stream itself, to the bugs. If dissolved oxygen is present in the waste stream, the bacteria will consume that oxygen first since it is readily available and provides more energy to the bacteria. This results in less nitrate broken down and more nitrogen in the effluent from the plant which may be above set limits.</p>
        <p>Anoxic Mixers are designed to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Suspend solids and provide complete basin control</li>
        <li>Promote bacterial breakdown of nitrate so the nitrogen can escape</li>
        <li>Eliminate air (oxygen) incorporation from the liquid surface (no swirl or vortex)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Anoxic basin may contain fibrous material not screened out of the waste stream or stopped by the grinders in the front end of the waste treatment plant. This fibrous material has been found to agglomerate on hydrofoil (i.e. high efficiency) impellers, typically used in flow controlled applications. Replacing the hydrofoil impeller with the RL-3 Ragless Impeller will shed the fibrous material and prevent build-up, and therefore mechanical issues, with the mixer. </p>
        <p>When the fibrous material builds up on hydrofoil impellers, the process flow pattern becomes more radial rather than axial in nature, typically resulting in a swirl or vortex on the top surface. This incorporates oxygen into the basin which the bacteria use first and less of the nitrate is used as an oxygen source. The RL-3 will maintain the strong axial flow pattern and performance of the agitator, eliminating the swirl/vortex on the top surface, and hence the incorporation of oxygen into the basin. This allows the bacteria to use nitrate as the primary source of energy and keeps the nitrogen levels in the effluent within permit levels.</p>
