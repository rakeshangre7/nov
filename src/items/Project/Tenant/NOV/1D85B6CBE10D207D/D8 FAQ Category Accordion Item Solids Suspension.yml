        <p>Solids Suspension applications are found in most industries is some form of another. The solids suspension procedure is used to ultimately provide an agitator to perform the process function. </p>
        <p><strong>Category: </strong>The Solids Suspension ChemScale design procedure should be considered whenever</p>
        <p><strong>Size: </strong>The size of an agitator problem for the Solids Suspension ChemScale is the &ldquo;Equivalent Volume.&rdquo; Equivalent Volume is equal to the actual volume multiplied by the specific gravity of the slurry.</p>
        <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Solids settling velocity is the difficulty parameter in solids suspension applications. The settling velocity is measured or calculated by using the particle size distribution, weight %, specific gravity, and the liquid specific gravity and viscosity.</p>
        <p><strong>Dynamic Response:</strong> The ultimate purpose of a turbine agitator is to achieve a desired process result. For solids suspension applications, the dynamic response if fairly easy to quantify and are broken down into the following categories:</p>
        <p><strong>Solids Motion:</strong> All solids are in motion on the tank, bottom but not completely suspended. Solids will build-up on the tank bottom over time if they do not dissolve</p>
        <p><strong>Off-Bottom Suspension:</strong> All solids are suspended off the tank bottom and will not accumulate over time</p>
        <p><strong>Uniform Suspension:</strong> All solids are suspended off the tank bottom and uniformly distributed throughout the tank</p>
