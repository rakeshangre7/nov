        <p><strong>Dewatering services</strong></p>
        <p>Our dewatering services perform two vital functions. First, dewatering removes up to 99.5% of solids from unweighted drilling fluids, returning essentially clear water. This is important to reduce hydrostatic fluid column pressures and increase rate of penetration. Second, dewatering significantly reduces waste volume for off-site removal and disposal. The dewatering system includes one or more decanting centrifuges, a polymer aging and injection system, and pH adjustment. Solids, in the form of a dry cake, fall into a catch tank for storage, testing, and handling before disposal. The clean liquid phase is either returned to the mixing tank or sent to a holding tank for preparation and discharge.</p>
