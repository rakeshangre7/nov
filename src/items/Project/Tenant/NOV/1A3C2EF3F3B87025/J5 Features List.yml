        <p>We have two pressure vessel models currently available with 130- and 220-ft³ capacities. Our pressure vessels are skid-mounted with an enveloping lift frame, and the bulk material is loaded and discharged pneumatically.<br />
        <br />
        Our skid-mounted bulk cement transport vessels are designed in accordance with DNV Standard for Certification No. 2.7-1, but they may be certified to other customer specifications. The pressure vessel is also designed to the requirements of ASME Sec. VIII, Div. 1, current edition as well as for registration with the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors.<br />
        <br />
        This vessel comes complete with 5-in. fill, vent, and discharge ports in the side of the tank, as well as a 20-in. Wilco™ manway in the vessel cone. A 3-in. connection in the side of the tank feeds a set of aeration jets in the center of the tank for pressurization. Other aeration methods may be specified by the customer.</p>
