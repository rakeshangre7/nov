        <p>In preparation for the start of a 2-year contract with BP for the Gulf of Mexico drillship, Diamond Offshore sought to differentiate the <em>BlackHornet</em> with the most cutting-edge drilling innovations available. Through a partnership, NOV was then able to deliver the first full automation package for an offshore upgrade.</p>
        <p>During <em>BlackHornet&rsquo;s</em> 5-year survey and equipment upgrade, the drillship was outfitted with NOV&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOT5DjacwiI">Multi-Machine Control (MMC)</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=965076B82A5D4D268CA250F78B85DE8A&amp;_z=z">NOVOS</a>&nbsp;automation technologies, which automate repetitive drilling activities to improve rig safety and performance. Upgrades also included NOV&rsquo;s Cyberbase 14 integrated drilling system and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xpe6odzZiw">Machine Control Diagnostic Tool (MCDT)</a>&mdash;the first of its kind and unique to the industry&mdash;which empowers rig personnel to increase uptime, reduce service costs, and increase safety.</p>
        <p>Marc Edwards, President and CEO of Diamond Offshore, recognized the improvements gained by adding NOV&rsquo;s solutions to the rig: &ldquo;Through close collaboration with our partners and a continued commitment to innovation, Diamond Offshore&rsquo;s recent investments in our Blackships has made them some of the most efficient and highly automated rigs in the world.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We were pleased to work closely with Diamond Offshore&rsquo;s engineering, operations, and executive teams to deploy our NOVOS automation and Multi-Machine Control systems on the <em>BlackHornet</em>,&rdquo; stated NOV Chairman, President, and CEO Clay Williams. &ldquo;The technologies allow hoisting equipment, piperackers, roughnecks, and associated floor tools to move in preprogrammed paths controlled from a single joy stick, speeding up operations and removing personnel from danger. Diamond Offshore and NOV have meaningfully enhanced the performance and safety of what was already a world-class drillship by utilizing the latest automation and control technologies, making this rig one of the most technologically advanced drillships in the world.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Highlighting the partnership with Diamond Offshore, BP Vice President of Wells GOM Sarah Gay cited the companies&rsquo; &ldquo;open-minded[ness] to new ideas as well as providing strong perspective[s]&rdquo; as the reason behind the ability to implement &ldquo;agile methods to maximize delivery and minimize unnecessary or duplicate work&hellip; result[ing] in some of the most state-of-the-art rigs, equipped to deliver safer ways of working, emission reductions, and increased efficiency.&rdquo;</p>
