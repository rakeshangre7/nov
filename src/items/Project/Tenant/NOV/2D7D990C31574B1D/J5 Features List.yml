        These pumpers use the Hydra Rig™ direct-fired vaporizer, triplex pump, cold ends, and boost pumps to provide gaseous nitrogen at pressures up to 15,000 psi (103 MPa).<br />
        <br />
        The most severe operating conditions are no match for our patented cold ends, which are proven to perform in harsh environments. Simple operation and control is provided by the Merlin™ automated vaporizer controls that are unique to our equipment. The controls of the pumping unit can be configured to match each individual operating environment and can be located in a climate-controlled cabin or externally on the side of the unit. Operation of unit control valves can be done manually or remotely using electric actuators.<br />
        <br />
        Power is supplied by a Cummins QST30 (1,350 hp) deck engine with an Allison S8610M transmission. Liquid nitrogen is stored at -321 °F (-196 °C) in a 2,987-gallon (11 306-L) vacuum-insulated tank. All units are available with a CSA B620 TCRN Certificate for Transportation of Dangerous Goods on Canadian roads.<br />
        <br />
        We can also incorporate magnetic filtration into the hydraulic coolant, engine coolant, fuel, lube oils, and liquid nitrogen circuits, improving reliability and reducing maintenance costs.<br />

        <h2>Direct-Fired Trailer-Mounted Nitrogen Pumping Unit</h2>
        <p>Our Hydra Rig&trade; trailer-mounted nitrogen units can be customized to fit your operational needs&mdash;in both non-fired and direct-fired configurations. These pumpers use the Hydra Rig direct-fired vaporizer, triplex pump, cold ends, and boost pumps to provide gaseous nitrogen at pressures up to 15,000 psi (103 MPa).</p>
        <p>The most severe operating conditions are no match for our patented cold ends, which are proven to perform in harsh environments. Simple operation and control is provided by the Merlin&trade; automated vaporizer controls that are unique to our equipment. The controls of the pumping unit can be configured to match each individual operating environment and can be located in a climate-controlled cabin or externally on the side of the unit. Operation of unit control valves can be done manually or remotely using electric actuators.</p>
        <p>Power is supplied by a Cummins QST30 (1,350 hp) deck engine with an Allison S8610M transmission. Liquid nitrogen is stored at -321 &deg;F (-196 &deg;C) in a 2,987-gallon (11 306-L) vacuum-insulated tank. All units are available with a CSA B620 TCRN Certificate for Transportation of Dangerous Goods on Canadian roads.</p>
        <p>We can also incorporate magnetic filtration into the hydraulic coolant, engine coolant, fuel, lube oils, and liquid nitrogen circuits, improving reliability and reducing maintenance costs.</p>
