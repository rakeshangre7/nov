        <p>We manufacture flexible pipe systems for the offshore oil and gas industry and the chemical and wastewater industry. We help you build out subsea infrastructure with pigging, hot-tapping, and tie-in solutions. We&rsquo;re also pioneering a subsea storage system, have developed subsea coolers, and introduced our subsea water treatment system, Seabox&trade;, which takes water treatment from surface to the seafloor.</p>
        <p>We complement our integrated solutions with dedicated support throughout your entire project, and we continue to expand the operational envelope for subsea oil and gas production in an open and honest partnership with our clients.</p>
