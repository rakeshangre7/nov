        <p><strong>Fast, accurate makeup and breakout</strong><br />
        The 8147 CRFlex&trade; unit is the latest addition to our TorqueMaster&trade; line of make/break torque machines. This self-contained, freestanding continuous-rotation torque unit is designed for fast and accurate makeup and breakout of premium threaded connections and multiconnection tools with various diameters.</p>
        
        <p><strong>More managed torque</strong><br />
        Its fully electronic touchscreen control incorporates a torque/turn logging system that logs connection data and automatically stops the torque process at your desired set point, reducing the possibility of overtorque and damaged connections. A database containing connection parameters can be used to set up the torque requirements, eliminating clerical errors when setting up the connection for makeup.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Simple operation</strong><br />
        Powered by our Flex&trade; series independent hydraulic power unit (HPU), the CRFlex is ideally suited for any application in which continuous-turn capability is desired, such as completion tool service shops. The unit requires only an electrical power source and is designed for simplicity of operation and maintenance. Customizable to fit your facility, the nonslip bed and beams come in various lengths to ensure the equipment matches your process and space.</p>

        <li>Safe data – PDF connection reports are saved for every connection and can be copied to a USB memory stick or printed at the console.</li>
        <li>Remote HPU – Separating the HPU from the control console reduces the noise, vibration, and heat from the work space.</li>
