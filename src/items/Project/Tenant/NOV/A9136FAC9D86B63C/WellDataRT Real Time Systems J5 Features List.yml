        <p>The WellData application allows you to view designated reports/data for the wells and rigs pertaining to your operations. The well list homepage can be quickly customized for each user to make information processing easier and more efficient. Division groupings can be created within the now customizable fleet view to help users quickly advance through fleet information. The application also allows the user to share the data in a concise and organized manner with other users. Each user has the ability to automate information retrieval. For ease of use, customized drilling data text files can be sent at user selected time intervals. Report customization allows IADC activity codes to be summarized and data for a given date range reported across wells to enable more informed decision making. </p>
