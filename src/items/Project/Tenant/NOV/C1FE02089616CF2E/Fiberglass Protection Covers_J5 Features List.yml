        <p>We deliver bespoke subsea infrastructure impact protection systems fitted to your specifications. If your construction or protection project has any kind of corrosion, weight, or access problem, it is likely that we can design and build a fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite solution for you.</p>
        <h2>Cocoon and Shroud</h2>
        <p>The Cocoon and Shroud&trade; product is designed as a snag-free, lightweight, and slippery structure to provide the wellhead with protection from fishing net incursions. The concept was uniquely devised to reduce the cost and size of large conventional over-trawlable structures, particularly the cost of deployment and installation.</p>
        <p>The Cocoon approach uses the primary structural parts of the subsea production structure as the anchor instead of a dedicated foundation. Our Subsea Production System equipment is designed for significant loads and therefore has the capacity to support the cocoon and any accidental incident loads during its service life. The design uses a conventional guide base with the addition of a &ldquo;skirt&rdquo; below the guide base to complete the Cocoon and Shroud shape. This results in a simple, elegant design that can be modified to suit local requirements for the NCS.</p>
        <p>More than 30 Cocoon and Shroud protection systems have been deployed for a North Sea customer during the past 17 years.</p>
        <h2>Impact protection covers</h2>
        <p>Our impact protection covers combine superior strength with a lightweight construction that enables deployment in very challenging conditions.</p>
        <p>Constructed from a resin-infused FRP composite, our impact protection covers shield the subsea oilfield pipeline equipment from practically any physical damage. They are tailored to make a perfect fit for the operator&rsquo;s existing proprietary equipment and fixtures and designed to last for the duration of the field&rsquo;s design life while still being as easy to install as they are to remove.</p>
