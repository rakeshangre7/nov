        <br />
        Our cryogenic cold ends are designed to complement our NP-200 power end (Triplex) but are also compatible with most other manufacturers’ power ends using a 1.38 in. stroke. These are available in a range of sizes from 1¼ to 3¼ in. and working pressures up to 15,000 psi.<br />
        <br />
        Large cryogenic cold ends used for high-flow and pressure applications—like nitrified fracturing, foam cementing, and pipeline pigging—are also available. This larger range of Hydra Rig cryogenic cold ends is specifically designed for use with the NP-1000 and NP-1600 power ends, which are compatible with most other manufacturers’ power ends using 2 and 2¼ in. stroke. These are available in a range of sizes from 115/16 to 3½ in., output flows from 360,000 to 420,000 SCFH, and working pressures from 7,000 to 15,000 psi.</p>
