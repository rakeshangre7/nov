        <p>Our 1-in. ION Alpha&trade; cutter technology is designed to achieve maximum rate of penetration (ROP) in applications where performance is limited by conventional-sized cutters. The ION Alpha cutter is polished to increase efficiency in high depth-of-cut (DOC) applications and in various rock types.</p>
        <p>The ION Alpha cutters are paired with our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=121C7FF19B0B4B1F9BAB38AE7F688C8C&amp;_z=z">Tektonic&trade;</a>&nbsp;drill bit philosophy to achieve record-breaking ROP runs with improved dulls in tough applications. Additionally, our proprietary drill bit modeling software allows us to take advantage of the ION Alpha cutter&rsquo;s increased DOC without suffering from traditional reactive torque-related issues experienced in a wide range of drill bit sizes and applications. </p>
        <p>The ReedHycalog team is always looking to improve their products, and the ION Alpha cutter will be further developed to incorporate ReedHycalog&rsquo;s most advanced shaped-cutter technologies. Shaped cutters deliver the highest possible ROP without sacrificing durability, and they&rsquo;re designed using state-of-the-art testing equipment that provides an in-depth understanding of rock-failure mechanics. ReedHycalog engineers combine these understandings with extensive full-bit lab tests that will help optimize ION Alpha shaped cutter placement and deliver new levels of cutter performance for our customers.</p>
        <h3 class="J5-features-list__headline">ION Alpha 1-inch cutter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Maximizes ROP by increasing the available DOC</li>
            <li>Increases cutter life through ION application-specific cutters grades</li>
            <li>Highly polished diamond surface reduces friction, improves efficiency, and avoids balling in high DOC applications</li>
            <li>Further improves drilling efficiency by implementing the latest shaped cutter technology</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="J5-features-list__headline">Tektonic design philosophy and proprietary design software</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows engineers to balance aggressivity and reactive torque</li>
            <li>Minimizes instabilities that lead to durability and steerability issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Durability &ndash; </strong>confirmed impact-resistance improvement over traditional cutter sizes</p>
        <p><strong>Stability &ndash; </strong>established performance on bent-housing motors and in interbedded applications, meeting all directional objectives</p>
        <p><strong>Steerability &ndash; </strong>consistent torsional response with excellent tool-face control in directional applications</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency &ndash; </strong>field-validated ROP improvement under the same parameters in high DOC and balling applications</p>
