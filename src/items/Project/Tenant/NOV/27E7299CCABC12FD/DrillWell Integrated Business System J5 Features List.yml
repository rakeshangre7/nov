        <p>DrillWell is a web-based reporting application that provides users with a wealth of wellsite information that is readily available, easily accessible, and packaged to provide the user with the information necessary to make informed business decisions that will ultimately provide better business results. Starting at the wellsite with NOVs RigSense Report Management System (RMS), information collected from the IADC tour sheets and morning reports are sent via satellite to WellData and ultimately on to the DrillWell application. DrillWell consolidates report data electronically from every rig into a central database. Standard reports are generated and are instantly available to any user having security rights to the information. DrillWell enables the user to consolidate, query, and arrange data to highlight meaningful trends, improve focus on trouble spots, and improve overall operations. </p>
        <p>With DrillWell, downtime analysis has never been easier. From DrillWell users can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine what equipment (top drive, drawworks, etc.) are causing the most downtime and analyze this by company, region, superintendent, rig manager, etc.</li>
            <li>Identify rigs with lowest and highest downtime</li>
            <li>Review %DT and DT Hours and analyze by company, operator region, superintendent, rig manager, etc.</li>
            <li>Review summary data or details of each downtime event</li>
            <li>Analyze downtime by equipment models</li>

Standard reports are generated and are instantly available to any user having security rights to the information. DrillWell enables the user to consolidate, query, and arrange data to highlight meaningful trends, improve focus on trouble spots, and improve overall operations. </p>
        <p>With DrillWell, downtime analysis has never been easier. From DrillWell users can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine what equipment (top drive, drawworks, etc.) are causing the most downtime and analyze this by company, region, superintendent, rig manager, etc.</li>
            <li>Identify rigs with lowest and highest downtime</li>
            <li>Review %DT and DT Hours and analyze by company, operator region, superintendent, rig manager, etc.</li>
