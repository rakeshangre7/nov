      Value: "<p>Our Yale Figure 500 SafeGuard lugless closures provide productivity, durability, and safety for the most critical installations. The lugless feature of the SafeGuard closure prevents in-field safety risks associated with hammering on the closure cap lugs as well as the potential for damage to the closure that could hinder its sealing capability and shorten its service life. Our Yale SafeGuard closure can be easily operated with a standard 24- or 36-in. pipe wrench.</p>"
