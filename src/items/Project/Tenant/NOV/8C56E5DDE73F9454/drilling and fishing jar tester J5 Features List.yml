        <p>Downhole Jar Tester units are rugged, self-contained units that test the proper operation of fishing jars, drilling jars, and other downhole drilling tools. The horizontal mainframe and attached hydraulic cylinder efficiently apply tension and compression forces in direct axial alignment with the test piece.</p>
        <p>Each Downhole Jar Tester unit is designed for safe and efficient operation by one person from a low-pressure, electric-powered, stand-alone hydraulic control console. These test units can also be operated as an accessory to the NOV Model 1689 and 8025 TorqueMaster&trade; makeup/breakout unit consoles.</p>
        <p>Test nubbins needed to connect the test piece to the unit are sold separately and should be specified with size and connection type at time of inquiry.</p>
        <p>For inquiries, please contact your local NOV sales representative or email DH-ServiceEquipment@nov.com.</p>
