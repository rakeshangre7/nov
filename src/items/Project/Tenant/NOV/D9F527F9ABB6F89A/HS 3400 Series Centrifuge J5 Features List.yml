        <p>The HS-3400 series centrifuge is fed from the solids end of the conveyor. Mud is introduced into the feed chamber through a feed tube and exits into the bowl via four nozzles. The HS-3400 FS exerts up to 2,275 G&rsquo;s on the mud, while the HS-3400 VSD, HS-3400 FVS, and the HS-3400 VS exert up to 2,100 G&rsquo;s.</p>
        <p>The HS-3400 FS is a fixed-speed drive unit, whereas the HS-3400 FVS and HS-3400 VS are equipped with variable-frequency drive (VFD) control, which provides a controlled application of motor drive power to the centrifuge components (bowl, conveyor, and feed pump). Hardware and software packages can be custom-designed to specific installation and operational requirements.</p>
        <p>The HS-3400 VSD is a hydraulically driven unit with a variable speed bowl drive. The HS-3400 FVS is electrically driven, with both the bowl drive and conveyor equipped with variable speed. The HS-3400 VSD and HS-3400 FVS centrifuges offer increased operational flexibility in situations for which conditions vary.</p>
        <p>With a processing capacity up to 200 gal/min (757 L/min), the HS-3400 series centrifuge offers outstanding performance in a wide range of drilling applications and conditions. Contact your NOV sales representative for more information.</p>
