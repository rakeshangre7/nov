        <p><strong>EIA actuators are well-control components used during a subsea well intervention.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It features a single-line hydraulic system and an automatic, wedge-type, "autolock" actuator system. The autolock system secures the rams in the closed position in the event of a hydraulic failure or an emergency situation that requires disconnecting from the subsea wellhead.</p>
        <p>There are two sets of rams: blind shear rams and grip seal rams. Blind shear rams are designed to cut the coiled tubing and/or wireline to form a blind seal. Grip seal rams are designed to grab, hold, and seal around the coiled tubing.</p>
        <p>Each EIA BOP can be built to your specific design requirements, including a dual-bore valve block with a combination of blind shear and grip seal ram assemblies. The combi rams offer increased functionality and the ability to use a wide range of coiled tubing and wireline sizes in a field-proven, compact design. All pressure ratings and service applications are available, including certification for use in the North Sea.</p>
