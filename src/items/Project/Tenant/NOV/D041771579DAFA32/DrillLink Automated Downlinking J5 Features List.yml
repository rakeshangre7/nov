        <p>Our DrillLink system features pull-down software, which means the right instruction for each tool is always loaded to reduce human error. Since the commands are now precise and repeatable, the tool manufacturers can modify their communication systems to allow faster, more efficient downlinking operations. The DrillLink system provides an intelligent interface between service companies and existing rig control systems in an efficient, reliable, and non-intrusive communication format.
        </p>
        <p>Our DrillLink system digitizes and modifies the driller's throttle signals to send precise downlinking commands by using the rig's own control system to regulate the speed of the mud pumps. With DrillLink automation, the code in the downhole tool can be modified to recognize shorter duration pulses, resulting in time savings of 50 to 85%.</p>

        <p>The user-friendly interface of our M/D Totco&trade; DrillLink&trade; automated control system generates command sequences for downlinking to rotary steerables and other downhole tools, eliminating the need for the directional driller to constantly monitor a stopwatch while giving verbal instructions to the driller.
        </p>
        <p>Our DrillLink system features pull-down software, which means the right instruction for each tool is always loaded to reduce human error. Since the commands are now precise and repeatable, the tool manufacturers can modify their communication systems to allow faster, more efficient downlinking operations. The DrillLink system provides an intelligent interface between service companies and existing rig control systems in an efficient, reliable, and non-intrusive communication format.
        </p>
        <p>Our DrillLink system digitizes and modifies the driller's throttle signals to send precise downlinking commands by using the rig's own control system to regulate the speed of the mud pumps. With DrillLink automation, the code in the downhole tool can be modified to recognize shorter duration pulses, resulting in time savings of 50 to 85%.</p>

      Hint: description
      Value: "<p>The M/D Totco&trade; DrillLink&trade; automated downlinking system enables service companies or other approved users to communicate with downhole tools without the need for manual commands, bypass valve systems, or other flow-diverting mechanisms. The patented system serves as an interface tool, which provides select 3rd party providers access to the rig's pump controls for automated downlinking of command sequences. The DrillLink system features pull-down software meaning the right instruction for each tool is always loaded to reduce human error. Since the commands are now precise and repeatable, the tool manufacturers can modify their communication systems to allow faster, more efficient downlinking operations, allowing the Directional Driller to make more course corrections without regard to rig time, if necessary. This can improve wellbore quality with reduced dogleg severity, resulting in less drilling torque, less drag while tripping, and reduced drillstring wear. </p>"
