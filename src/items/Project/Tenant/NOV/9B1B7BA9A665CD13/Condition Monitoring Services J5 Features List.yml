        <p>Rigsentry bridges the technological gaps between traditional maintenance, condition-based maintenance (CBM), and other maintenance optimization approaches. We are the first and only original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to be certified by both ABS and DNV-GL as an approved supplier of condition monitoring services for drilling and subsea equipment for Rigsentry.</p>
        <p>With solutions for land rigs, topside drilling packages, and subsurface pressure control equipment, the Rigsentry family provides detailed insight into the health of your equipment. Visit nov.com/rigsentry for more information.</p>
        <h2>Rig condition monitoring services</h2>
        <p>Rigsentry rig products and condition monitoring services provide a detailed view of the health of NOV equipment and empower you to operate and maintain it more effectively. Accurate information for monitoring equipment health enables predictive maintenance programs, contributing toward continuous recertification when major services and overhauls are triggered by equipment condition. The move to a CBM model changes the way you schedule and execute maintenance, helping you spend your maintenance efforts where they count the most.</p>
        <h2>Blowout preventer (BOP) condition monitoring services</h2>
        <p>Rigsentry BOP products and condition monitoring services are designed to facilitate CBM and maximize subsea uptime. On the rig, information is collected from the BOP control system to monitor cycle, flow, runtime, and time-in-service data from equipment components. The subsea equipment undergoes constant analysis to detect any latent failures. This includes the compliance with regulatory standards and the statistical likelihood of equipment remaining within your operational limits for the duration of the well. We want to partner with you to create end-of-well maintenance plans that are tailored to your rig, resulting in a lower total cost of equipment ownership.</p>
        <p>Learn how to identify failure before it happens.</p>
