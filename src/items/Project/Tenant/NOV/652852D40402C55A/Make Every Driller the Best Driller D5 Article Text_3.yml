      Value: "<p>NOVOS was recently deployed to the North Slope drilling area for Parker Drilling and BP. Using the system enabled Parker Drilling to achieve consistent bottom-to-bottom time savings and an overall safer drilling process. Doug McCrae, BP Technical Deployment Specialist, said, &ldquo;BP has got an ambition to lead the industry in automation. It&rsquo;s about making it a more safe environment and more cost effective in that element as well. If we can get consistent and safe, that&rsquo;s nirvana for us. We keep people away from harm&rsquo;s way. That&rsquo;s one of our biggest drivers.&rdquo; Another benefit was increased consistency in executing discrete aspects of the drilling processes, which reduced unpredictability for the rig crew and driller. This increased awareness, safety, and delivery of the overall drilling operation, further highlighting the ability of the system to maximize value for both the contractor and operator.</p>"
