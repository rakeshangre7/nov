        <p style="color: #000000; background: white; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in;"><span>Boarding shut-down valves (BSDVs) are the most critical safety component of a subsea system. Used for isolating offshore facilities such as production platforms, compression platforms, and FPSOs from riser, our High Pressure and Temperature (HPT) Gate Valves act as an automatic emergency shutdown valve in the case of a power supply loss. Installed on the pipeline boarding riser, the BSDV assembly includes a valve and hydraulic or pneumatic failsafe-closed actuator.</span></p>
        <p style="color: #000000; margin: 0in 0in 3pt;"><span>Our BSDVs, also known as the riser isolation valve or riser emergency shut-down valve, provide maximum safety for the people aboard your production xfacility. The valves are designed to meet rigorous Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) requirements of monthly, not to exceed a time period of 6 weeks, leak rate tests for high-pressure and low-pressure testing. Our BSDVs are manufactured in Houma, Louisiana and can ship globally.</span></p>
