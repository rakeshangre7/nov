        <p>Our Agitator&trade; tool, the most powerful, reliable, and trusted friction reduction technology on the market with nearly 100,000 runs worldwide, is now able to be activated downhole and on-demand based on application needs and customer preference. With the simple drop of a dart, the Agitator&trade;HE On-Demand system will start gentle axial oscillations to break friction at the exact depth desired by the driller based on well profile demands, casing designs, weight transfer challenges, or directional issues noticed with the opportunity to improve ROPs. </p>
        <p>The new AgitatorHE On-Demand System design is based on the long-established AgitatorHE technical platform, incorporating many design aspects that bring new operational functionalities to our customers to take the well-known performance, reliability, and product quality to the next level. Our AgitatorHE On-Demand technology provides a step change in the way the drilling crew interacts with the downhole drilling environment and puts the driller in the driver&rsquo;s seat to activate the friction reduction power of the Agitator System when he or she feels is appropriate.</p>
        <p>With 100% downhole activation success as of December 2019, the AgitatorHE On-Demand technology is empowering our customers to rethink the way they drill their wells.</p>
