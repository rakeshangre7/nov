        <p>Our Red Thread&trade; IIA Piping systems are UL 971 listed for all UL-identified applications and fuels, including alcohol and alcohol-gasoline mixtures of either ethanol or methanol up to and including 100%. The piping system is compatible with biodiesel and E85 fuels.</p>
        <p>Red Thread IIA Series Piping costs 63% less than 2-in. coaxial flexible pipe and 46% less than 1&frac12;-in. coaxial flexible pipe. Red Thread IIA Series Piping also costs 20% less than Red Thread IIA Traditional/Parallel Layout Piping.</p>
        <h2>30-year warranty</h2>
        <p>With over 50 years proven performance in the marketplace, UL 971 Listed RED THREAD IIA pipe, fittings and adhesive carry a 30-year warranty. The product is warranted to be free from defects in material and workmanship and against internal and external corrosion when used for underground transportation of fuels.</p>
        <h2>Leak prevention</h2>
        <p>UL 971 bonded sump entry fittings provide positive seal at the sump preventing leaking of underground fuel in or out of the sump. Our Bonded Sump Entry Fitting - Termination Style also provides Class I protection which complies with California&rsquo;s requirement for continuous interstitial monitoring (Spanish) of the piping systems&rsquo; secondary containment.</p>
        <h2>StationWare 3000</h2>
        <p>StationWare 3000 is a stand-alone CAD program that provides a professional-looking station layout drawing and an accurate bill of materials for the site.</p>
        <h2>Secondary Containment</h2>
        <p>When secondary containment is needed, Red Thread IIA provides a true pipe-in-a-pipe system. Containment pipe is identical to the primary pipe. Sections are joined together with matching two-piece clamshells that are bonded and bolted together. One-half of the clamshell fitting is prefitted with female-threaded fasteners to make assembly fast and easy from one side of the fitting.</p>
