        <p>We continually test new and better materials to meet the demands for ever-changing well conditions. Extensive field tests make certain new packing stand up to stringent durability and performance standards. Cone packing is available in sizes for all polished rods 1 through 1&frac34; in. in sets of four (three top cones and one bottom cone) and five (four top cones and one bottom cone).</p>
        <h3>NOV Packing types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hercules Gold: For sweet crudes with high oil-to-water ratios, low sand content, and where salt or corrosion buildups on polished rod have caused premature wear of other packings</li>
            <li>Soft cone packing: For sweet crudes with high oil-to-water ratios and low sand content</li>
            <li>Hard cone packing: For sweet crudes with low oil-to-water ratios</li>
            <li>Slick Pack&trade; (Compound S&trade;): For reducing polished rod noise "squeaking" in noise-sensitive locations on crudes with high oil-to-water ratios and low sand content</li>
            <li>Special lubricated: For sweet crudes with high oil-to-water ratios and low sand content</li>
            <li>Heavy-duty: For prolonged service on sweet crudes and wells without constant flow</li>
            <li>PTFE filled: For sweet crudes and wells with long stroke and fast pumping cycles</li>
            <li>Compound C: For steam injection wells producing sweet crudes</li>
            <li>Compound G: For H2S and CO2 wells</li>
            <li>Slick pack with Teflon flakes (Compound ST): For reducing polished rod noise ("squeaking") in noise-sensitive locations on sweet crudes that pump off or have long stroke and fast pumping cycles</li>
            <li>Compound D: For steam injection wells where polished rod scoring is a concern</li>
            <li>Compound H: For steam injection wells</li>
        </ul>
        <p>* These guidelines are for general reference purposes only and should not be used as the sole determining factor for packing material selection. Each downhole condition is different and must be addressed on a case-by-case basis to determine the best material solution for each well.</p>
