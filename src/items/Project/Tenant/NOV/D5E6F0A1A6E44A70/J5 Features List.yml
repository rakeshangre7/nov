        <p>An optimal flexible pipe system is one in which flexible pipes and accessories are designed as a whole. Only through a correct configuration is it possible for a system to meet all design specifications throughout the duration of its design life. At Flexibles, we leverage our knowledge of all pipe characteristics as well as our exhaustive approach to system analysis to provide the required elements for an optimal configuration.</p>
        <p>A flexible pipe system uses a range of accessories, from large and complex subsea structures (e.g., mid-water arch systems, pipeline end manifolds [PLEMs], and anchors) to smaller devices including goose necks, pull-heads, A&amp;R wires, and I/J tube seals. We have the engineering capability and capacity to design, specify, procure, manage, and incorporate the entire suite of required accessories into the desired flexible pipe solution.</p>
