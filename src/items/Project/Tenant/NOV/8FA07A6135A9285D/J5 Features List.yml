        We design and manufacture premium quality Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) pressure vessels which are the perfect fit for demanding offshore applications.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Our pressure vessels are manufactured from Bondstrand piping, which has been extensively used in offshore applications for the last 50 years. Manufactured using high quality glass and epoxy resin, and available from 4&rdquo; to 60&rdquo; diameter, our FRP composite pressure vessels provide a lightweight and corrosion resistant alternative to metallic pressure vessels - designed to extend asset life, and also outlast the asset.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Using the combination of our unique Advanced Design and Advanced Manufacturing (ADAM) capabilities, and the outstanding reputation for quality that Bondstrand piping has; we can manufacture FRP pressure vessels to client specified design codes, including ASME X.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        In-house capabilities in cutting-edge design and innovation, specialist fabrications, and a comprehensive range of engineering services allows our team of experts to provide high quality and tolerance, advanced automated manufacturing equipment and processes, as well as an all-inclusive solution, from offshore surveys, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Computer Aided Design (CAD), through to manufacture and installation.<br />

        <p>Our pressure vessels are manufactured from Bondstrand&trade; piping, which has been extensively used in offshore applications for the last 50 years. Manufactured using high-quality glass and epoxy resin and available from 4 to 60 in. diameter, our FRP composite pressure vessels provide a lightweight and corrosion-resistant alternative to metallic pressure vessels&mdash;designed to extend asset life and outlast the asset.</p>
        <p>Using the combination of our unique Advanced Design and Advanced Manufacturing (ADAM) capabilities and Bondstrand's outstanding reputation for quality, we can manufacture FRP pressure vessels to client-specified design codes, including ASME X.</p>
        <p>In-house capabilities in cutting-edge design and innovation, specialist fabrications, and a comprehensive range of engineering services allow our team of experts to provide high quality and tolerance, advanced automated manufacturing equipment and processes, as well as an all-inclusive solution&mdash;from offshore surveys, finite element analysis (FEA), and computer-aided design (CAD) to manufacture and installation.</p>
